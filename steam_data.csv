"Counter-Strike 2 - A Disappointing Departure from the Franchise's Legacy Introduction: Counter-Strike 2, the latest iteration in the iconic franchise developed by Valve Corporation, fails to live up to the lofty standards set by its predecessors. Despite the anticipation surrounding the sequel, Counter-Strike 2 falls short in multiple aspects, leaving longtime fans and newcomers alike with a sense of dissatisfaction. Underwhelming Visual Upgrades: One of the most disappointing aspects of Counter-Strike 2 is its lackluster visual upgrades. In an era where graphical advancements are expected, the game's visuals feel dated and fail to capitalize on the potential for immersive environments. Character models lack detail, and the overall aesthetic lacks the modern polish seen in contemporary shooters, resulting in a lack of visual impact. Stagnant Gameplay Mechanics: Counter-Strike has always been known for its precise and tactical gameplay, but Counter-Strike 2 does little to innovate or evolve the mechanics that made the franchise a success. The gameplay feels stagnant, offering little in the way of fresh features or improvements. With other shooters pushing the boundaries of the genre, Counter-Strike 2 feels like a missed opportunity to breathe new life into the series. Lack of Innovation in Maps: Counter-Strike has a rich history of iconic maps, but Counter-Strike 2 disappoints with its uninspired map design. The lack of innovation in both visual style and layout results in a sense of déjà vu, with maps that feel all too familiar. The absence of new, memorable locations diminishes the excitement of exploration and strategy that the Counter-Strike series is known for. Microtransaction Overemphasis: Counter-Strike 2 leans heavily into microtransactions, introducing a plethora of cosmetic items and skins that often feel disconnected from the game's military aesthetic. The emphasis on monetization detracts from the core experience, creating a sense that the game prioritizes profit over player satisfaction. The overabundance of microtransactions undermines the purity of the Counter-Strike experience. Inadequate Anti-Cheat Measures: The prevalence of cheaters has long been a concern in the Counter-Strike community, and Counter-Strike 2 does little to address this issue. The inadequate anti-cheat measures result in frustrating gameplay experiences, with legitimate players often encountering unfair advantages from those exploiting the system. This lack of effective countermeasures tarnishes the competitive integrity of the game. Poor Communication and Community Engagement: Counter-Strike has thrived on its dedicated community, but Counter-Strike 2 struggles with poor communication and community engagement from the developers. The lack of transparency regarding updates, bug fixes, and the future direction of the game leaves players feeling disconnected and uninformed. This lack of engagement fosters an environment of uncertainty and frustration within the player base. Technical Issues and Unpolished Release: Counter-Strike 2 suffers from a myriad of technical issues and a general lack of polish that is uncharacteristic of a major release. From connectivity problems to in-game glitches, the overall stability of the game is compromised. The decision to release the game in such a state undermines the reputation of the Counter-Strike franchise for delivering high-quality, polished experiences. Conclusion: Counter-Strike 2 disappoints on multiple fronts, failing to evolve the franchise in a meaningful way and neglecting the elements that made its predecessors legendary. With underwhelming visuals, stagnant gameplay, an overemphasis on microtransactions, and inadequate anti-cheat measures, Counter-Strike 2 falls short of the expectations set by its iconic predecessors. The lack of innovation, poor community engagement, and technical issues make Counter-Strike 2 a regrettable entry in a series that once set the standard for excellence in the first-person shooter genre.",655.6,0,0

"CSGO was great. The community servers were awesome and the main reason I played the game. However, the forced merger of CSGO with CS2 has rendered the state of the servers and communities nearly obsolete, replaced by an inferior, but prettier version of the game. What was fun, is now anti-fun. Part of this is due to the poor performance and higher demand required to play CS2, but also because the larger more complex custom maps can no longer be played. In addition, what took over 10 years to build a rich and highly detailed variety of custom maps has been wiped out with this update. It will probably be several years until we even reach parity with the quality of custom maps that CSGO had, if the community survives. If you are someone who was/is part of Zombie Escape community, thank you for playing throughout all these years. Also, thanks to the creators of the custom maps and their continued support, despite Valve. Playing this game mode (and others) was a blast.",1648.3,0,0

"I love CS, but CS2 was simply a downgrade from CSGO, game feels clunky, I guess the maps look good, but I always liked the rustic feel of CSGO. Not really sure what I was expecting, but I was excited, and it just simply did not deliver. Missing commands, shadow updates, numerous bugs, loss of content, lag, and more. The game is just simply a worse version of CS. With that being said, I understand that game launches will never be perfect, but you cannot compare this to the launch of CSGO. Valve makes like 50m a month on cases, so you would think they would have at least provided a ready game. I am sure one day when the product is actually finished that CS2 will be a great game, but as of now it is just not up to the standards it should be.",83.7,4,0

"CS2 becoming more and more boring, if a game can't be imaginative and creative , it is dying. suggestion: 1. create a more reasonable system of evaluating the level and rank of players so that player can have fun with players of similar level. nobody want to waste time to play with others who are too far apart. 2.try to make the game a little more creative, such as creating 3 different body types of characters with different bounce heights and movement speeds and drawbacks; and protecting the torso from a single shot from an AWP with a super jumping leg move... 3.reducing the size of the head reduces the chance of headshots, and a good player should be a perfect combination of marksmanship and strategy. 4.left hand view is a must.",1894.7,0,0

"Counter Strike 2 is a highly anticipated continuation of the famous shooter game series. While the game brings many improvements and interesting new features, I have to mention that I found the movement of the characters to be quite strange and not very natural. Sometimes, it feels like the characters move in an unusual manner and it doesn't feel as fluid as in other similar games. Additionally, I have noticed that there are moments when death occurs frustratingly from someone who is running and shooting in a peculiar way. This can be quite disappointing and can lead to a less enjoyable gaming experience. However, I remain optimistic that the developers will address these issues and resolve these aspects in future updates. Counter Strike 2 has tremendous potential, with impressive graphics and a passionate player community. If the developers work on adjusting the movement and improving gameplay aspects, I am confident that this game will reach the level of quality and popularity of its predecessor, Counter Strike Global Offensive.",1121.8,0,1

"As someone with twice as much time in the Map Editor for CSGO as the game itself CS2 is one of biggest letdowns I've ever experienced. I don't think I'll ever understand why they clung to the Summer 2023 deadline rather than just waiting for content parity with CSGO. The import tools from CSGO to CS2 is not easy to understand and the documentation is confusing, and even when a map is successfully ported to CS2 it is likely to be missing half the assets because some maps just do not exist in CS2. The fact that this replaced CSGO means either I deal with the porting tools or just allow my work to be lost to time. So far CS2 has been nothing but letdown after letdown, do not bother with this game if you're looking for a game that caters to Counter-Strike's history of community content.",235.0,2,0

"The only reason I say no, is because there is Physics in CS GO, that somehow still hasn't made its way over to this game, its maps are fairly limited on rotation, and the hacker (or Server Latency issues) to player quantity is still about the same from this game to any of the previous games. Visually, its the same game with graphical upgrades, and interesting explosives. Gun accuracy appears to have tanked on everything but the AWP, which is something else entirely. This in a weird way makes Pistol more viable but, who needs that when you can also just get a random AK47 or M4S headshot. Also Value when are we getting another SWAT. I get making stories is hard but, Rainbow Six doesn't appear to be doing that anymore either so, you could be first back into the game.",37.8,0,0

"Spent way too much money, time, and nerves on CSGO, but I still LOVED every second of it. This CS2 bullsh*t, on the other hand, is pure garbanzo. Just a money grab. I did understand that the game was buggy, broken, and unfinished in the Limited Beta release, but now it has been officially fully released for more than 2 weeks, as of writing this, and the game is still unplayable. Performance issues aside, the game is just broken. How did they manage to fu*k up 2 of the best weapons in the game? -AK-47: You can't spray at all anymore; it seems super random. Bullet tracers don't help but make it even worse. -AWP: Flicks feel so bad; it used to be super fun to hit those insane flick shots on CSGO. Now, you have to aim at someone and just then shoot, which is Valorant's ""Operator"" 1/1. Maybe guns are just a personal problem; okay, I can understand that. Sometimes it's hard for a player with over 6k hours to adapt to something new, so let's talk about some other stuff. ""You get what you see."" Not only did they lock the servers to 64-tick, but there is not even a way to change it anymore. Subtick feels super bad. Shots don't go where you expect them to go. You kill people more often if you shoot behind/in front of them than if you aim directly at them. CSGO used to have a player model problem, where the hitbox of a character was not the same as the player model, but that's nothing compared to this. Also, dying behind a wall is something that you have to get used to because it happens 9/10 times if somebody peeks you while you try to hide. Missing commands are also a huge problem. -(cl_righthand) Many good CSGO players change the hand in which you hold the weapon mid-rounds because they want to see 2 different positions without having to move and lose the angle. That is not possible anymore. -(cl_bob_lower_amt) Most people that I know and watch used this command to stop the weapon from moving while you walk/run. Here, you cannot do it anymore, which is a shame because it is super annoying. -(r_cleardecals) You cannot clear the blood anymore, which makes a huge difference. Everybody used to bind it on a common button, such as shift, so when they want, they just clear it for better visibility. Valve used to be a highly respected company with titles such as Portal, Half-Life, and Team Fortress. Now, they are known as a money-making machine that just cares about cash going into their pockets and nothing more. They released a hardly playable game, which is a shame because I was a huge CS1.6, CS:GO, and Valve overall games. Also, we all know why they removed CSGO from Steam; it would be a hassle to add skins in both games every time they did an update. Such a shame.",1281.0,0,1

The updated visuals enhance the overall immersion, making every firefight feel more realistic and intense. Sound Design: The sound design in Counter-Strike 2 deserves special mention. From the distinct footsteps echoing through different environments to the satisfyingly realistic gun sounds, every audio element contributes to the immersive atmosphere of the game. It's not just eye candy; it's ear candy too. New Features: Counter-Strike 2 introduces several new features that add depth to the gameplay. The ability to customize weapons and equipment loadouts adds a layer of strategy, allowing players to tailor their approach to different maps and scenarios. The inclusion of a robust ranking system and seasonal events keeps the community engaged and motivated. Community and Support: The developers have shown a commendable commitment to fostering a vibrant community around Counter-Strike 2. Regular updates, responsive support, and a clear dedication to addressing player feedback demonstrate that the team is invested in the long-term success of the game. Conclusion: Counter-Strike 2 is not just a sequel; it's a testament to the evolution of tactical gaming.

"So I have not the foggiest idea what Valve has done but this game is completely unplayable: 1. No settings were carried forward from CS:GO and as such I have: - lost my cross-hair settings, - lost my handedness (I am a lefty), - lost all my keybindings and related settings. 2. When attempting to set the game to full-screen mode with a 16:9 aspect ratio, there are no options for the correct resolution for my monitor/NVIDIA settings/Windows 10 settings; ie 1920 x 1080, the highest I am able to set it is 1600 x 900 which is beyond fuzzy and unclear. 3. When trying to change any video settings; ie brightness and advanced options, etc; the resolution automatically reverts back to 1600 x 900, even after after setting optimum settings in NVIDIA to force a resolution of 1920 x 1080. 4. After doing a full reinstall, there is now severe and brain glitching audio stuttering, hearing all sounds a minimum of 2 or 3 times. Upon further investigation, it appears that no matter how high-end the PC being used these audio issues, to date, remain unresolved. Resetting all settings to default also does absolutely nothing to resolve any of the above issues. I am absolutely disgusted by the unfulfilled big promises, such as forward compatibility (which only seems to apply to money-generating items, such as skins). Additionally, the vast majority of maps seem to be missing as well as the casual and fun game modes, such as Arms Race, etc. Furthermore, CS2 has completely overwritten and voided all the CS:GO achievements which many of us have spent countless hours working on. I was quite excited about this rework of a classic game, however, it has been completely butchered and we do not even have the option to play the original CS:GO. So congratulations Valve on another job well done, it is truly no wonder why the only lonely achievement for CS2 (which appears to be gained by simply playing a round, including “return to training day” against bots) has only been acquired by 13.1% of all players.",490.1,0,0

"I was really looking forward to CS2, and graphic updates, but while certain things are improved like lighting, I just felt like somehow the gameplay isn't as fun as it used to be with custom maps and also the direction Valve choose to head in. The visuals to me feel worse than CS:GO. I miss the realistic tones the game used to have and I was also looking forward to more more exclusive maps for CS 2 that would make it stand out from CS:GO. After years of playing CS, I've finally decided to uninstall.",761.6,1,0

"Gonna preface this by saying, I'm no professional. I get that this game needs polish and yes it released too early I agree, but that does not make this a bad game by any means. As of recent CS2 has felt heaps better than it did at release. The game is tons of fun to play especially with friends and with how the new engine reacts and looks is absolutely stunning. I would change some things of course, premiere ranking system (not sure what was wrong with the old ranks), per map ranks on comp, bringing back Overwatch or implement better anti-cheat, etc. but Valve is not just gonna let one of the biggest competitive shooters just die. These things will come in one form or another and this game will be everything people want it to be, will just need time. Overall, 8/10 loving the game and find myself playing it more than I did with CSGO.",703.9,0,1
"I've been a Counter-Strike fan since the early days, and I was eagerly anticipating the release of Counter-Strike 2 (CS2). From the moment I booted up the game, I was blown away by the visuals. The Source 2 engine brings the game's environments and characters to life in stunning detail, and the overall graphical overhaul is truly impressive. The gameplay is also top-notch. CS2 retains the core mechanics that have made Counter-Strike a success for over two decades, but it also introduces new features that make the game feel fresh and modern. The team-based gameplay is as strategic and intense as ever, and the game's competitive depth is unmatched. However, my enjoyment of CS2 has been dampened by the prevalence of cheating. I've encountered a number of cheaters in my online matches, and it's starting to ruin the experience for me. It's frustrating to play against someone who is clearly using aimbots or other hacks, and it makes it difficult to enjoy the game's competitive nature. I know that Valve is working on improving VAC, but it doesn't seem to be enough at the moment. Cheating is a serious problem in CS2, and it's something that Valve needs to address as soon as possible. Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is a visually stunning and mechanically refined first-person shooter that would be a lot more enjoyable if it weren't for the prevalence of cheating.",409.6,2,1

"ALL they had to do was fix the smokes and update the graphics, maybe play around with gun balance. Instead we get an absolute mess, peekers advantage so insane you don't even see people on your screen before you die, added randomness to sprays to remove a previous core skill of the game, moving accuracy buffed so you end up getting head-shot by people full running with AKs on a regular basis, hit reg worse than csgo, just an absolute disaster of a sequel. Add onto that the fact the cheating problem was not addressed in the slightest and the new matchmaking system is just as broken as the last one. These were the two main complaints from the community and they didn't even try. It's obvious the passion of valve is long gone by now, I guess all that steam money and case money removes any incentive to actually try. P.S Using all of the old reviews from csgo as if cs2 is just an update is dishonest business practice, and the fact that enough people have gone to the effort of going back and editing their review to drop the score this much shows just how bad this game is.",951.5,0,0

"Dota 2, the iconic multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) game developed by Valve, stands as a testament to the depth and complexity that the genre can offer. With its steep learning curve, diverse hero roster, and strategic intricacies, Dota 2 has cemented its place as one of the most challenging and rewarding competitive games in the world. From the outset, Dota 2 impresses with its stunning visuals and attention to detail. The diverse and intricately designed heroes, each with a unique set of abilities, contribute to the game's rich tapestry. The maps are expansive, and the visual effects during intense clashes are nothing short of spectacular, creating an immersive experience for players. The heart of Dota 2 lies in its strategic depth. Matches are not won by individual skill alone but require teamwork, coordination, and a deep understanding of hero synergies and counterplays. The game's draft phase, where teams select their heroes, sets the stage for intricate mind games and strategic planning, adding a layer of anticipation to each match. The dynamic metagame ensures that no two matches are alike, as players adapt to patches and balance changes, keeping the gameplay fresh and exciting. The constant evolution of strategies, combined with regular updates and new hero releases, contributes to the game's longevity and the enthusiasm of its dedicated player base. Dota 2's esports scene is legendary, with annual tournaments like The International boasting record-breaking prize pools. The level of competition and the sheer skill displayed by professional players add to the game's allure, making it a spectator sport that captivates fans worldwide. However, Dota 2 is not without its challenges. The learning curve can be daunting for newcomers, and the community, while passionate, can be unforgiving to those still mastering the game. Additionally, the length of matches can be a double-edged sword, offering epic battles but also demanding a significant time commitment. In conclusion, Dota 2 is a masterpiece of the MOBA genre, offering an unparalleled blend of strategic depth, skill expression, and a vibrant competitive scene. While it may not be the most accessible game for newcomers, those who invest the time to master its complexities will find a rewarding and enduring gaming experience that continues to evolve with each passing season.",279.7,0,1

It's not for the faint of heart, but if you can survive the storm, you'll come out the other side with stories to tell and a newfound appreciation for the diverse world of Dota 2.",1468.1,1,1

"Dota 2 is among the most complex games. MOBAs only end when a base collapses, in contrast to other games like first-person shooters and fighting games, which are always played with a time restriction. Compared to League of Legends, Dota 2 has a larger area with less teleportation, meaning that resource and economic management is a laborious process in the game. You purchase the greatest things with the cash and experience you gain from taking out enemy heroes, camps, and creeps. Things start to radically shift for both teams towards the end of the game. Ascension is a major theme in Dota 2, which offers players countless strategies for defeating their rivals. For essential items, teams can purchase Black King Bar, Lotus Orb, and Linken’s Sphere to deter any incoming debuff. There’s also a long list of tier 5 neutral items that players can pick up from creep camps after the 60-minute mark. Heroes also get stronger and stronger with talent trees that provide amplified stats on either skills or attributes. Players also have the ability to prolong engagements with the Buyback option, which truly matters in the late game where death timers reach minutes. Looking at the map, you have bounties, runes, and outposts to capture as well as Roshan who provides the Aegis of the Immortal — an item that resurrects a fallen hero to full health and mana — and some cheese. Needless to say, Dota 2 doesn’t shy away from giving limitless opportunities to players and teams. With no real time limit to the game, you’ll experience thrilling wombo combos and defiant item builds in every match that you play. Going seven years strong as a casual Dota 2 player, I’m still dumbfounded at a lot of things that I see. It might even take another seven years for me to nail everything down to a tee.",5995.4,0,1

"the game is great, but match making is terrible. Tons of smurfs, trolling on new players. A lot of toxic dudes on this game. People keep losing MMR owing to crap match making. Some teams are great whilst most times pathetic and painful!! Losses pile up and the frustration builds. Dota is a team game, and can be ruined thanks to some idiotic players and smurfs...MMR should be calculated basis individual skill/stats and game play and not based on wins and losses which are totally dependent on horrible teams formed through rubbish match making.",2581.5,0,1

"Game sucks, I hate it with a passion but cannot stop playing it for some reason. you know if you win or lose in the first 10 mins of a match, but you need to stick out the remainder of the 45mins anyways. Match win is almost fully dependent on who picks the most OP hero, and gets the best start. Out of almost 500 matches, I've had maybe 5 comeback wins. The learning curve is big, but its mainly just learning the hero skills and what items to buy (also you'll be buying the same thing every match, there is little to no variation in the matches) Valve also claims to change the meta with patching heros, but this generally just results in minuscule changes, and even buffs to already OP heros.

The dynamic nature of the game, with ever-evolving team compositions and in-game events, keeps matches engaging and challenging.",1826.6,0,1
"Dota 1 veteran here. The reason Dota 2 do not gain new players is because they're scared of being matched with people with 10,000 hours who thinks they know the game. I've matched against people with 10,000 hours of playtime, I completely obliterated them in a rank game. Nobody knows everything in DOTA, we're all here figuring it out. Every game is unique. It is normal to lose some games. This Game 's skill Ceiling is very high. Very Enjoyable if you know what you are doing. The Internet says the game is dying, this is not true. Always being patched regularly, you will get mad because of huge updates and your main being nerfed. Communication is a must, don't pick up the game if you don't play as a team. Carrying your team is the goal.",535.6,0,1

"nowdays the game is pretty boring... people are not trying to get kills they just camp in houses and you have to start a game over and over again, it's frustrating, but it's not the big Issue - Ping adventage ruining alot of opportunities, 1 player shoot on another player at the same time - the one with the lowest ping going to get the kill and the other one dies without connecting any shot, all the items you get now from Ingame is ""Not tradable"", you cannot sell it in steam, you cannot trade them, that is just bound to your account and you basically cannot do anything about that but ""Adding money"" to make some upgrades to the weapon or just Puting alot of hours to get some scraps. We cannot talk to each other for the first 1 minute, There is no ""China number 1"" or ""I'm a Snake Follow me"" anymore. There are still alot of bugs and Lower fps for those with ""High end PCs"" We cannot play Cross Regions anymore, The game became worse and worse with the time i hope the developers will see my review about the game so they'd consider watching more feedbacks about the game and listen to the players so the game will be much more enjoyable and fun like it used to be back in the day.",857.8,0,0
"I, like many other players, am very disappointed in PUBG. This game was promised as the future of online gaming, but in reality it is a complete failure. It constantly slows down and lags, which makes the gameplay not only slow but also terribly annoying. In addition, the game's graphics look outdated and are not up to modern standards. Also, I don't like the way PUBG developers treat their players. They don't listen to feedback and don't improve the game according to user requests. Instead, they release new updates with bugs and errors that only make the gameplay worse. Overall, PUBG is a game that I wouldn't recommend to anyone. Not only is it not enjoyable, but it is a complete waste of time and money. If you want to play a good online game, you better choose something else.",73.2,0,0

"""PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds (PUBG) is an intense and immersive multiplayer shooting game that delivers a thrilling survival experience. Set in a vast battleground, the adrenaline rush of competition is constant as you vie against other players to be the last one standing. Realistic graphics and strategic gameplay add excitement and tension to every match. However, occasional bugs and sometimes irregular updates can impact the gameplay experience. Nonetheless, PUBG remains a captivating title for fans of epic battles and tactical strategy.""",2.1,0,1

"I am a long follower and player of pubg since watching Node and their zombie series. I waited and waited for it to come to console, then finally got a PC of my own. I cannot recommend PUBG anymore, it is aged and is outpaced in terms of battle royale enjoyment for me. It is slow paced, you will go 15 minutes of looting and not seeing anybody then one engagement that you have no idea where you got shot from and your back in the lobby. This isn't just me crying because I'm bad too. The amount of people playing this game that are actually from NA amounts to that less than a population of a farmstead in the middle of nebraska. You will not enjoy your time with this game once you are past your bot lobbies. Recoil will take ages to learn. Audio is so loud you can tell the room and building some dude is in from the other side of the city. You might have some good games, but overall the skill gap and sweats will stop you from enjoying over 10 hours these days.",159.7,0,0

"Pubg Visuals as well as game stablization is improved over the years and now its a good game just a simple flaw of security in game which some player use to cheat and disturb other players in Ranked Matches too. Pubg is one of its kind Battle royal games thats are available at steam, It has Free and Plus Activation for Ranked Matches but over the years I have not seen any improvement regarding those users who use malicious software to cheat and also mocks other players while playing ranked matches. So I request PUBG Corp to look at this issue and try to get Pubg at a more safer level of gaming.",743.7,0,1

"Very clunky, glitches, bugs, FPS drops, desync, you name it! Still, I can live with all of the above... One thing I cannot stand though is the massive cheating/hacking which ruins the experience for everyone. You can drop in Pochinki, Pecado, Boot Camp, Podvosto or Hayek and wipe the entire city, only to have a hacker kill you with a suppressed 4x Beryl spray from 200m mid-game and ruin it for the entire team. People cheat blatantly and the developers do little to stop them. And when they do ban them, it is a ""temporary ban"". What do you mean ""temporary""? If you cheat, you should get banned permanently. End of story. The only thing they are good at is selling silly content (weapon skins, costumes, season passes, etc...) instead of focusing on the more pressing matters. I have no faith in what the developers say or promise anymore. Utterly disappointed.",483.8,0,0

"It keeps you playing, so you feel like playing match after match and forgetting about the time. The graphics are very good, you can customize your character as you want, you can drive cars and you have different weapons at hand to put down your enemy. The coolest part is that you can play in a team of 2 or more, promoting the ability to play in a team and at the same time to create strategies so that you reach the first place. If you are very good you can even play rank so that you can test your skills learned on normal games. Overall it is a very good game, to play alone or with your friends, and i am pretty sure that i will continue to learn, play and enjoy the game even more from now on. 😄😄😄",15.1,1,1

"In simple terms this game can be summarized into two words ""TRASH GAME"". On a detailed note, here is what I found out after my frustrated gameplay sessions spanning over few months. 1. One of the worst optimized game that I have ever played in my experience. The game literally hiccups when you have an airplane flying over you. I noticed this across different system specs. I had a ryzen 5 3550 H with GTX 1650 with 4Gb Vram, on all low settings and my fps drops from 60 to like 25. My friend has the exact same issue, where he has an i9 13900k with RTX 3060 12 Gb Vram running on all low settings, his fps also drops like from 100 to 50-60 fps. Well in this case there is no point blaming my system specs as the issue. I don't need more than 60fps to have good gameplay experience. But the devs are no longer bothered in polishing the game to make it better. I know it requires a complete redo from scratch, but the sheer incompetence from PUBG devs simply makes this game a joke. 2. The same issue occurs when there are so many players concentrated in one region like making a hot drop or in the final zones. Just when the game needs to work smooth, you get the worst fps. Simply making the gaming experience unfair. With such a low TTK in the game the fps drops makes this game unplayable. And sometimes you don't even need much players to have the fps drop, just one or two enemies close to you is more than enough. 3. Every single game has players using recoil scripts. There is like almost 50% people running recoil scripts and it is pretty evident from watching the crosshair motion in spectate and replay mode. 4. Then you have players using macros to fire DMRs as if its is mk14 on full auto. 5. Then you have the wall hack people trying to sniping you across hard building walls with their wall hacks. 6. Then you have aimbots, but are somewhat less nowadays i guess. 7. Then there is the issue of bad hit register, where you fire at an enemy hit your shots, see the blood getting spilled but you literally did zero damage because he somehow killed me first? The biggest BS I have seen and dealing in this game. For people who says its my ping, I guess 54ms is not a bad ping to have such issues. 8. Being a free game has its pros but even more is the con especially when PUBG doesn't ban the hardware upon finding players are cheating. PUBG says or atleast we hope, bans players upon finding they are cheating, then they make new account (free game right?) and people with literally underwear and less than lv10 headshots you with beryl miles across the second you peek a wall with all the recoil scripts and aimbots. Again another big joke i.e. the pie charts PUBG posts every week regarding the players they ban and trying to show the community that they are making the gameplay experience better. 9. Most games, as of the date of posting ,are filled with bots. In a 100 player game, there will be around 40 real players and 60 bots. And new players are so happy getting kills on the bot as if they have carried the game. There are literally people who shoot at a bot just to get that easy kill even when there are actual players trying to get him. 10. I have to emphasise the fact that having an in game chat with teammates is a feature that will help when playing with randoms. Especially when the majority of the population playing this game are reluctant to speak the common language english or don't know to speak english at all. Out of like 10 games 9 games will have people who literally can't utter a word in english. But PUBG says they are matching me with people who speaks english and they even have a team finder option to match with people who speak the same language. Biggest BS of a feature PUBG has provided in the game. My native language is not even english but dude, if you can't speak or understand english, what is the point of even giving comms in random matches especially when you get matched mostly with people who can't speak or understand english. Hopefully there is a higher chance they can read english. But meh. 11. PUBG should allow people to select servers manually, that way atleast people can get into nearby servers where people can atleast communicate in same language and have some fun in random matches. 12. PUBGs movements are so janky. Sometimes you have to tap multiple times to get into ADS mode right after you exit out of a vehicle. I have died so many times in a 1v1 encounter, where the game literally hesitates to get me into ADS mode right after I exit vehicle. 13. You can't aim below horizontal level while you are shooting from a vehicle? I mean like what sort of a game mechanics is that? Its not even comparable in real life. I have died to enemies countless times, especially in scenarios where two vehicles crash and simply just because my vehicle was slightly at a greater elevation, and not being able to aim below horizontal level, I die. 14. Last but not the least, WTF is WELLBIA SECURITY SERVICE?Is it some chinese/korean malware,spyware or cryptominer?Every single time I start PUBG it keeps asking me to install wellbia security service 3 times. There is already an EAC running with the game and why is there even a need for some fishy additional software? And it literally makes no difference. I tried this. First I installed wellbia and found it running with pubg and even after i closed the game, assuming that wellbia was their EAC. Then i uninstalled the entire game and declined the permission to install wellbia. The game still works the same except now i don't have a chinese/korean fishy software running in the background always. If the game works without wellbia, why even ask players to install some fishy software. I mean already people don't trust them, and top of that literally exposing themselves of being the same fishy people. Nice job PUBG. I am ending this list here. There are literally so many more issues in the game and I don't want to waste my time anymore writing a review. My 2 cents on the people reading this review is, please try to stay away from this game and let the game die slowly. That way a lot of legit players will be saved from countless issue starting with system security and mental health. Please help the community by letting the game die.",273.1,3,0
"Game is so boring. It is nothing but camping in a building clenching your cheeks and waiting for someone to walk into your view. Every single match I have played I have died to people camping in buildings and not moving or by getting sniped down by someone posted up on a mountain with a sniper. There is never any up close fights, it is always dying to campers or getting sniped at from far away. The game takes no skill, the movement feel like you are playing in slow motion. The weapons are boring and not fun to use at all. If you even get a chance to fire that weapon.",26.1,0,0

overall good free to play shooter 3 strikes has been awesome here recently i will be very sad to see it go. i only recently started playing it on steam. i hope they keep it going in a good direction the normal battle royal is fun but gets dry after a wile. i think it would be good for all if they brought back arenas but i doubt the would do so. sometimes there is a bit of balancing issues but the big thing about battle royals for me is that they are fairly balanced and i think that apex is overall. would recommend if you if you like shooters/battle royals in general.,145.5,0,1

"Product received for free After getting over 3000 hours combining my Steam and Origin playtime, reaching level 500 back when that mattered and grinding with my friends all the way to Diamond league, I can't help but feel heartbroken over my poor time's waste. The masterfully made seamless inventory system, the satisfying weapons, the iconic maps and amazing music are all ruined by, of all things... the Legends. Time and time again, skill and risk-taking behavior are pushed aside for rock/paper/scissors combat based on crutches on a timer. Accuracy, positioning and movement can all be overridden with a push of a button just because someone picked a Legend to counter yours. Annoying scans, gas, get-out-of-jail-free-cards, pods that lock you to the ceiling to keep you from finishing off an enemy off guard. Apex isn't great because of the Legends, but despite of them. We don't need them. I gave up hope and haven't touched it since 2021. And until a bare-bones mode is added so I can play without them, I don't have the heart to touch it again.

"This is Apex legends. A game once at the top of the gaming foodchain. Oh, how far have we fallen?! THIS GAME IS/HAS been in a critical state since 2018, The fact that people are getting actively persuaded to play this game boggles me. there have been entire videos dedicated to this games future and their problems; If you don't recognize how horrible of a state this game is in as of late 2023; You're already addicted; addicted to the pain of playing the game. Addicted to the micro transactions, Addicted to the characters. As a drug substance abuser. this game is horrible for your health; It's horrible for your mental space. And most importantly it's a horribly loved game. Do not vote this game for ""Labor of love"" Apex legends has been out for a ridiculous time now and it's just a bad experience playing C&BT with the game devs through twitter comments that such a big company has to this date NEVER addressed any of playerbases wishes to the full graphical and wise extent. Essentially. what it all boils down to, is that when you play this game and input 50$ or something. You'll get cheap knockoff trash; developers Don't have incentive to do their job; Leaders at Apex HQ will never be able to properly give this help the game it needs in order to generate billions more dollars in profits Investing such 50$ into basically any other game is huge; Small developers are infinitely more-so incentive based; because the survival of their game and company and dreams to make money off such game directly correlates to the money they recieve... THIS IS NOT THE CASE FOR ANY TRIPLEAAA TITLE! PLEASE LOOK AT THE PATTERNS. STOP FUNDING TRIPLE AAA GAMES ENTIRELY; THEY NEED TO BE BOYCOTTED THIS GAME HAS BEEN ABANDONED!

"Not to brag but after 200 hrs, I'm still bad at apex. In Conclusion, If you are considering getting in the mix in Apex, don't. You aren't meant for this game. The very fundamentals of the game are designed to hate new players. If you don't get how the guns work or how the abilities work you are destined to die in every encounter. Every once in a while the stars will align and you will get a heroin hit of a team wipe. However, just like heroin, it fades quickly when you die on the next encounter. This game is for the people who are still playing it since release. For those who have made a name for themselves and as such cant let the game go. Totally New Gameplay! The matchmaking system is the wackiest ive ever seen. Instead of taking your skill in combat into account, It's based on your survival. If you run and hide, you will get into the top 5 often and therefore be better. However, you will be thrown into harder and harder lobbies where you don't win fights. The guns are absurd. In the right hands, they will 2 shot you, in your hands they won't kill. No matter how many shots you put in. Snipers are an actual joke taking 3 to 5 shots to kill. The Ultimate's range from being handy to useless. Your character often has a strange glow that makes it very hard to stay hidden. Weapon xp is simply retarded. You get more xp by holding the gun then actually using it. The Legends are mostly annoying. Some will talk as if the Apex games are a tightrope of life and death and others talk as if it's just a backyard BBQ party. The maps are fine The community seemingly has a 30/70 split between helpful and hateful respectively. Either they complain about your lack of experience and demand that you leave. There is a shocking amount of randoms that will go off on their own and then die and in a shocking twist leave the game. Of which they will be penalized for. It's every 2 or 3 rounds.",202.2,0,0

"I would've recommended this game around S13-S14, unfortunately that's not the case anymore. Here's a quickfire of all the things I think are negative in this game - Uninspired skins, lots of re-colours of already released skins - Bad matchmaking, Diamonds and Masters in Rookie lobbies - Bad community - Bad audio - Bad hit registration (the servers are running at 20 ticks, mind you today's standards are 64 tick or even 128 tick, you can find multiple clips of hit reg issues in Apex, just search on youtube) - Bad ranked system (for ~3 Seasons now) - Takes too long to update and fix bugs (sometimes a bug can exist for up to 90+ days in this game, because developers refuse to hotfix stuff unless it's Shop related) - Horrendously overpriced items (20 euros for a recolour) - Bad developers (Respawn has lost a lot of respect due to how they're managing the game) - Boring / uninspired events - Takes ages to progress and unlock characters (384h and I still don't have all the characters unlocked just because I'm not playing 24/7) - Too many sweats, not good for casual gamers who just want to chill and play a BR game Here are the things I think are positive about this game - Good gunplay - Good movement As you can see, the bad outweigh the positive in this game's case. Of course, it's up to you whether you give it a try or not, but be careful, the game has some addictive elements that might get you hooked without you even noticing!",385.2,4,0

"The game has huge potential, interesting mechanics and very diverse battles. But there are a lot of problems that haven’t been fixed since the game was released. the main ones are: 1) unstable servers 2) frequent packet loss and non-reg 3) console players with aim assist 4) incorrect selection of players AND probably the worst thing is the sounds. Apex is already 4 years old, I'm willing to tolerate many of the shortcomings in this game, but it's very weird that they just can't get the sound just a little bit right. Very often you simply cannot hear other players, it also happens that even a whole squad running near you may not make a single sound... I hope correcting the sounds will be a priority",744.1,1,1

"Want a great FPS Battle Royal game? Look no further than Apex Legends. Whether you loved and miss Titanfall 2 or you have never experienced this universe you will love Apex Legends. There is a large variety of legends and weapons to play, unique maps, fun different game modes, and decent balance of casual vs competitive play. While it does have in game micro transactions, these are purely cosmetic and have no effect of the game. Also just by playing it is very easy to unlock pleeeeeenty of cosmetics with ease. The battle pass each season also has great cosmetics, is only $9.99 and gives you more than enough in game currency to purchase the next battle pass for free if you mostly finish it (which is not difficult). While this game has had times where players disagreed on the developers focus at a particular time (be it continuing to add too many legends and weapons or the current metas), this game is always fun. Additionally, the developers listen to players and have always been headed in the right direction when adding or balancing new content in the game even if it takes a few modifications. Apex Legends if fun and engaging, whether you stick with it and hone your skills or just pop in occasionally for some fun FPS.",1557.9,0,1

"Not a good game for Indian players, the closest server for us Indian is Singapore and it is very bad server, its not working properly, when this game was new, my friends and I use to play this game with no problems and actually it was hack free game, i never spot any cheater back then, now this game is focused on updating new season, adding skins, possibility of quick money grab events, and god knows what else in future, but they never worked on their servers, if we ask support about this they just blame us for having poor internet which is not true at all, they just give me average tech support advice to fix this like, restart my internet, restart or reinstall the game etc. I will definitely change my review if they someday finally decide to fix the issue, my Friends and I can manage to play this game with 300 ping but 50%-70% of packet loss, it is not possible to play.",705.8,0,0

"Product received for free As of my last knowledge update in January 2022, Apex Legends is a popular free-to-play battle royale game developed by Respawn Entertainment. The decision to play Apex Legends on Steam or any other platform often depends on personal preferences and the features offered by each platform. Steam is a well-established gaming platform with a large user base, and it provides certain advantages such as a centralized library, social features, and easy access to updates. If you already use Steam for other games and enjoy its features, playing Apex Legends on Steam could provide a seamless and integrated gaming experience. Moreover, being on Steam might expose the game to a wider audience, potentially bringing in new players and communities. Additionally, Steam often has sales and events that can provide opportunities to get in-game items or the game itself at discounted prices. However, it's essential to note that the state of gaming and platforms can evolve, and new developments may have occurred since my last update. Always check the latest reviews, community feedback, and any changes or updates related to Apex Legends and Steam to make an informed decision based on the current scenario.",726.7,0,1

"Product received for free Gameplay (9/10): Apex Legends stands out with its intense and fluid gameplay. The game's emphasis on team play, innovative ""ping"" communication system, and character abilities add layers of strategy beyond traditional battle royale mechanics. The introduction of Apex Legends' distinct ""Legends"" – each with unique abilities – adds an extra dimension to the gameplay, requiring players to adapt and collaborate for success. The addition of the ""Champion"" system, where the previous match's best squad becomes the target for other players, injects an extra layer of excitement into each round. Graphics and Art Design (9.5/10): Visually, Apex Legends is a feast for the eyes. The game boasts stunning graphics, vibrant colors, and intricate level design that sets it apart from other battle royale titles. Each character, weapon, and environment is meticulously crafted, contributing to an immersive and visually appealing experience. The dynamic weather and day-night cycle further enhance the game's overall aesthetic, creating a world that feels alive and constantly evolving. Sound Design (8.5/10): Apex Legends' sound design is generally solid, with distinctive audio cues for different actions, such as footsteps, gunshots, and abilities. The game's music adds to the atmosphere, intensifying during crucial moments. However, there are occasional issues with audio balancing, where certain sounds can be too loud or too soft, impacting the overall experience. Respawn Entertainment has been proactive in addressing these concerns with regular updates, showcasing their commitment to refining the game's audio experience. Content and Updates (9/10): One of Apex Legends' strengths is its commitment to keeping the game fresh with regular updates, introducing new legends, weapons, and events. The seasonal battle pass system provides players with a consistent stream of content, ensuring that the game remains engaging and relevant. The evolving narrative through in-game events and lore keeps the community invested in the game's universe. Community Engagement (9.5/10): Respawn Entertainment has demonstrated a commendable dedication to community engagement. Regular developer updates, responsiveness to player feedback, and a transparent communication style have created a positive relationship between the developers and the player base. The active esports scene and regular tournaments further contribute to a thriving community.",724.9,1,1

"Why you shouldn't get into Apex. -20 tick servers. No, Respawn, 20 tick servers aren't ""actually a good thing"". It's pathetic that this has somehow been allowed for four years. -FOOTSTEP AUDIO BEING NONEXISTENT WHEN YOU NEED IT MOST. -Cost of cosmetics. I'm not even talking about Heirlooms and Mythics, I'm talking about regular skins. It's clear the agenda that EA and Respawn have is to milk money out of the playerbase for as little effort as possible. And, going back to Heirlooms and Mythics - how is selling these cosmetics for $160 or even up to $500 acceptable? Counter-Strike gets away with it because the skins have REAL WORLD VALUE. Heirlooms and Mythics do not. They have no functional value, they are not nearly worth the amount of money they are going for. -The strength of controller as an input. Unbannable controller scripts + CFGs AND 0.4 aim assist. So many people are making the swap because there are almost no downsides at this point. You're saying it's going to take YEARS?????? FOR A FIX? When you could just reduce the strength of aim assist NOW, and put your foot down on these wack loopholes? Actually disgraceful. (Controller players, don't mald, I think you guys should get official tap-strafe binds as well. I think movement is important to the game. But controller should NOT be a BETTER INPUT than MnK. That is like saying you should be able to draw better with a mouse than with a pen and tablet.) -No 120fps on next-gen consoles. When will this get delivered? If it's impossible, at the very least there should be an increase in frame rate to 90. Where is the communication? -Cheaters on East Asia servers and anti-cheat in general. Still incredibly problematic even if it doesn't affect NA as much. -Respawn/EA's refusal to come to an agreement with pro Apex eSports teams in regards to compensation for official organization skins. This has been and will kill off the competitive aspirations of Apex Legends as an eSport. -The story/lore. The recent Conduit cinematic shows that the new writers at Respawn have no idea what Titanfall stood for or how everything connected together. It seems every new character nowadays is some random ♥♥♥♥♥ who gains magical powers, or a shoehorned reference to TF2 without earning it. Conduit gaining shielding abilities from RADIATION??? The Titan that saved her would not have existed until AFTER the WAR?????? There is just so much wrong or mid about the lore and it's constantly sad to see Respawn consistently fumble. At the very least, Conduit isn't annoying as hell to listen to, unlike Catalyst or Valkyrie or Vantage, who are given the cringiest lines to voiceover. -CLEAR BIAS ON BALANCE UPDATES. How was SEER allowed to exist in the state he came out in for over a YEAR, and yet Bangalore, THE MOST BALANCED CHARACTER SINCE THE START OF THE GAME, as SOON as she's popular for a FEW MONTHS, gets NERFED IMMEDIATELY? It was a Digi-threat problem and EVERYONE knew it. Balance team, you are all clowns. The fact that Valkyrie hasn't been re-buffed after the addition of Evac towers, the fact that characters like Ballistic, Ash, Mirage, Lifeline exist without buffs for viability... Don't get into Apex. This is a doggy dog game.",1165.9,0,0

"Product received for free This game is really fun. I have built my skill over the years and can finally do more advanced movement. I will say this. 1) The community is diverse and generally supportive. 2) This game is NOT beginner friendly, basically new players will have a rough time if they don't have a carry. 3) This game is free which is nice... but the devs put little effort into pleasing the player-base because they get less money out of it that they're other games.

"Product received for free I actually have over 700hrs combined with origin. This game used to be peak back in season 7 through 9. The game is still fun, however I'm kind of upset with Respawn removing Arenas from the game. Arenas was my favorite gamemode and I literally only played that instead of the others. It also feels like they added too much content these past 7 seasons. I kind of stopped playing after Season 12 due to all of the changes. Would love to see Respawn bring back the OG maps (S7 Olympus, worlds edge, and skull town Kings canyon) from earlier seasons like Fortnite did. I would say the game is sort of fun still and new players might enjoy it, but I just want to revisit all the good memories I had from the earlier seasons. 7/10 Game",180.0,1,1

"Apex Legends is really fun to play with friends or the few couple of times with randoms. The gun-play is satisfying, the Legends system is fantastic, and the moments where coms are semi-tactical are just the peak of this game. There is a steep learning curve but it can be quickly overmastered if you just play the game with yourself and teammates in mind. People hate this game because they're the ones that solo drop in a team focused game, die, cuss out their teammates, then leave. This game is a team focused game that the devs are clearly proud with. Constant updates, loot pool changes, small mini-events, and a whole bunch of other things really keeps Apex Legends staying relevant; Its a great game. If you play this game, expect to be mad; its a PvP game after all, its not gonna hold your hand. Have fun with it, and most importantly; if you are mad, JUST TAKE A DAM BREAK!! Thx",413.8,0,1

"This city will eat you alive kid. If you let it. It's a big place, full of big dreamers. Optimistic artists, blind German fashion designers, kids fresh out of college trying to convince themselves that their acting degree is worth a f*ck... you name it. It's a cut-throat free-for-all. Every rat in the maze is gonna try to stab you in the back and clamber over your rotting corpse to reach the top of the pile. When I rolled in, I was as hopeless as everyone else. I got off that plane with nothin' but a clean change of clothes and a half empty bottle of bourbon in my carry-on. Nothin' to drive, nowhere to stay, and not a dollar to my name. All I had was Lamar Davis' phone number. God bless that man... He taught me something very important: when you're in a maze full of rats, you find yourself a pack. I signed on with an individual known simply as ""The Kewn."" He had merchandise to move, and I had a commercial driver's license. It was a match made in a crack den. To be honest, it was pretty degrading, but it put paper in my wallet. That paper put my name on a lease, a beautiful '72 Saber Turbo in the garage, and a God-blessed American firearm in my hand. It also bought a tiny little warehouse down on Elysian Island. Every empire starts somewhere, amigo. Mine started when I was blackout drunk. I sunk the chopper carrying my first ever load of cargo into the harbor, and somehow managed to drag the crate through the door before the law showed up. My assistant found me the next morning passed out in a pool of my own urine. Bit of a bumpy start, but that one crate laid the foundation for what I am today, baby. I clawed my way up to the one percent the old-fashioned way. I wasn't a hot girl who cozied up to some fat, bald Russian f*ck with a fifty foot yacht in Ibiza, full of ditzy, bikini-clad models. Nor was I a Harvard dropout who's daddy paid bail after I crashed my third Pegassi into a strip club, up to my eyebrows on marching powder. Those Shark Card scum who inherit generational wealth all wind up the same. The hot girls get cosmetic surgery in their late forties when their looks start to fade, inevitably facing the fact that they're bland, vacant shells of a personalty with nothing but a pair of big, pouty lips and a sub-average IQ. The Harvard dropouts graduate when papa makes a generous donation to the board, and then they use their complimentary finance degree in an attempt to re-enact before they die speedballing. Point is, unlike them, my hands are good and dirty. I'm out there every day flying the choppers, rippin' eighteen-wheelers down the highway, and having civilized, high-caliber discussions with Merryweather Security. Sure, I could kick back on my Aquarius and pop champagne corks at passing jet-skis every time my account jumps up six figures, but I'd run out of bottles pretty quick. Gets boring after a while. You see, I don't to be bustin' my ass this hard. Anything I could ever want is just a phone call away. At this point, the only reason to keep playin' is for the love of the game. But hey, that's what works for me. You've got your whole life ahead of you kiddo, and you can waste it however you want. Get into professional street racing. Skydive off of Mount Chiliad. Hunt people for sport. F*ck it, play Arena War if you're some sort of psychopath! Point is, you can do whatever. You. Want. Just don't forget that there's a million other little rats like you.",782.5,0,1

"After seeing this scene many times, I have realized that Lamar's roast is actually incredible. By acting as if he's in a hurry and talking quickly, he eliminates the opportunity for Franklin's counterargument, meaning that he can continue delivering his verbal critique. The use of the phrase ""yee-yee"" is especially clever as it has very loose meanings and is utilized to further demean Franklin while not being necessarily rude, as well as fitting nicely into the rhythm of Lamar's ""smack-talk"" as the youth say. Since a person's hair is usually one of their most stand-out and noticeable features, by ridiculing his, Lamar makes Franklin's identity feel attacked and being shorter means that he's opened to the perspective of one taller than himself having to look down at it, making him especially self-conscious. Furthermore, by berating Franklin's female partner, Lamar starts to get very personal with him which makes the insults even harsher, while also making Franklin feel inadequate in romantic relationships. As well as this, feigning uncertainty of her secret partner's occupation and referring to intelligent and respectable vocations such as ""lawyer"" and ""brain surgeon"" Lamar attacks Franklin's lack of a formal education. Finally, the strange and belittling way that he calls him the funny n word further aims to make Franklin seems foolish and by slightly squatting to make eye contact, Lamar subtly roasts Franklin's stature again, as well as his status, making him feel like an insignificant child. Truly, a genius in the art of ""roasting"" as the youth say.",240.1,1,1

"Product received for free the game is engaging and has a lot of missions in it. As i have purchased the premium version of this game, I can ensure you that this is a total game-changer while it was released in 2013. The online version has few hackers in it, but if you make your own private online, you can play alone there and enjoy all of the online exclusives. Totally gotta recommend this game!",48.5,0,1
After 228 hours I'd still recommend this game for the storymode and the online sessions are fun if you can get into one without modders ruining everything; I'd highly recommend getting into GTA 5 Roleplay through FiveM if you're interested in GTA. It's a much more immersive and fun experience in my opinion.,231.0,0,1

"Interested in the story or modded multiplayer? Go for it! If you're looking to get into GTA Online, save your sanity. Compared to a decade ago, it's in a horrid state. First off, you're no longer playing GTA when you're in multiplayer... you're playing a sci-fi version of Just Cause 3 on an unholy amount of steroids as you prevent World War 3 essentially. Additionally, everything's gotten far more expensive to encourage micro-transactions if you don't want to deal with the abysmal grind and there's even a subscription service now. The anti-cheat is utterly terrible... can't even join a single session without someone or several people using cheat scripts for the sole purpose of ruining everyone's day. No IP address protection, either. Only time the game gets a ""hotfix"" is to patch money exploits, anything else hardly ever gets touched. TL;DR: Single-player is good, online is awful.",1265.9,0,0

"""GTA V: The Loveable Old Grandpa Still Kickin' While We Wait for GTA 6"" Oh boy, where do I even start with this gem? GTA V is like that beloved old uncle who's been crashing on your couch for way too long—still stealing the spotlight, hogging the TV remote, and making you laugh despite overstaying its welcome. Let's talk about the game. It's like the eternal loop of chaos and shenanigans. You've got Michael, Trevor, and Franklin—these dudes are like the dysfunctional family members you secretly wish were part of your squad in real life. Michael, the retired bank robber turned family man; Trevor, the dude you wouldn't want to be left alone with your snacks; and Franklin, the guy you'd trust to parallel park your car blindfolded. The world of Los Santos is still more alive than my houseplants, and trust me, that says a lot. You can be a responsible citizen, driving obeying traffic lights... or you can hijack a blimp, fly over the city, and make a heartfelt speech to the seagulls. Your call. But let's address the elephant in the room, or should I say the lack thereof? Hey, Rockstar, where's GTA 6? Did you misplace it under a pile of cash or something? We're here, twiddling our thumbs, waiting for the next big thing while you're probably brainstorming ways to make us rob casinos on Mars. But back to GTA V—despite its age, it's holding up better than my attempts at adulting. The graphics might not be cutting edge anymore, but the storytelling? Still top-notch. The multiplayer? A haven for both chaos and camaraderie. And let's not forget the mods, because turning every car into a screaming flamingo or replacing the cops with angry chickens? Pure gold. So, here we are, giving this game yet another thumbs-up while simultaneously side-eyeing Rockstar for keeping us in suspense about GTA 6. Come on, guys, spill the beans already! Until then, I'll be in Los Santos, probably doing yoga on top of a moving train or trying to make friends with a gang of wandering llamas.",250.1,0,1

"I've played this game dozens of times, even achieving every trophy on PS4 (yes, including the criminal mastermind). I've invested in this game at least seven times, spanning across platforms such as PS3, PS4, X-360, Series-X, and three times on PC, and I've never regretted a single purchase. Undoubtedly, it stands as the most prestigious game of the last decade, and I sincerely hope its successor will be at least half as impressive. A heartfelt thank you to Rockstar Games for creating this truly greatest of all games!",25.0,0,1

"I am a 45 -year -old father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a single father raising my son, who is now 14 years old. My son won this game from his uncle, so we installed him on his computer and he started playing. Until the end of the week he had 24 hours in this game. This was horrible for me, because it was hard to find ways to spend time with my son, because he is always with friends or just watching Youtube. So I decided to do a Steam account and get this game to see if I could play beside him. I bought the game, chose my skin and world and started playing, but I was stuck in what you should do. I asked my son for help and he organized a game for me to participate. I loved it, because it was the best time I spent with my son since my wife died. Since then, this game has approached me and my son again and now we spend time together away from home as well. This game reminded me that there is fun in everything, and I brought many happy memories to me and my son.",51.0,2,1

"I like how the other reviews sound like Wikipedia articles. Here's an actual review from an actual person. If you said that GTA V is the best game of all time, I wouldn't argue with you. What Rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated. We're still playing it religiously, 10 years after it came out. One decade. Let that sink in. The use of three protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways we've never seen before. Getting three different perspectives on the same story is extremely interesting. Each of the protagonists holds their own; Trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever; I love the Al Pacino vibe that Michael gives off; and Franklin's journey is awesome to see. The gameplay is top-notch. I love the gunplay, and the driving is stellar; it's much better than the boat steering from GTA 4. The story is incredible; there isn't much of an emotional attachment, but it's still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs. I replay this game once a year because I love it so much. The map is one of the best out there, and there's a reason it's used when judging the maps of new games. Online is a completely different story; it's toxic and pay-to win. It's fun with friends, but random lobbies are awful. Overall, GTA V is a 5/5. There's really nothing that can bring down the score.",621.1,1,1

"""Grand Theft Auto V"" is the absolute kingpin of open-world gaming, and Rockstar Games has truly crafted a timeless epic that's still rocking it. Los Santos is more than just a city; it's a sprawling playground where every neighborhood has its own story to tell. From the glitz of Vinewood to the streets of Grove, the attention to detail is mind-blowing, making every corner worth exploring. The trio of main characters is a genius move. Michael, Franklin, and Trevor bring unique vibes to the story, and being able to switch between them seamlessly adds a layer of immersion that keeps things interesting. The story itself is a wild ride of heists, twists, and Rockstar's trademark satire on society. The writing is sharp, the voice acting is spot-on, and the cinematic presentation gives the whole narrative a blockbuster feel. And let's not forget GTA Online – it's a whole new world of criminal opportunities. Building your empire, pulling off heists with friends, or just causing chaos, there's always something to do. The regular updates keep the online experience feeling fresh and unpredictable. The gameplay mechanics are top-notch. The driving feels responsive, the combat is satisfying, and the range of activities, from serious heists to absurd yoga sessions, adds that extra layer of GTA charm. The soundtrack is a mixtape of perfection that sets the mood just right. Sure, the graphics show a bit of wear and tear considering the game's age, but the overall design and vibe of Los Santos still make it a visual treat. In a nutshell, ""Grand Theft Auto V"" is a masterpiece of gaming. The massive world, memorable characters, and the freedom to dive into chaos or follow the story make it a must-play. Despite its years, the game's still got that magic touch, making it a timeless classic that stands tall in the gaming hall of fame.",885.0,1,1

"I really enjoyed Grand Theft Auto V on release, and I still really like the graphics, soundtrack, and the overall gameplay. I find that the driving in particular is very enjoyable, and I don't normally care about driving in games. The story is weak, and focuses heavily on a funding war between two government agencies despite it being obvious that the interactions between the three main characters are far more interesting. However, over time, it has become harder to recommend. Rockstar is clearly making an absolute fortune from the online mode, and thus has focused all post-release development on this mode instead of doing any single-player DLCs. Unfortunately, the online mode is predatory in the same way that many mobile games are, and deliberately drags out the progression with long wait timers, big money grinds, and other artificial barriers designed to encourage players to buy in-game money with real currency to speed the process up. Many features in the online game, such as the ability to insure custom cars and have them delivered to you, are exclusive to online play when they almost feel like basic features which should be present in single-player mode. A lot of content, including literally hundreds of cars and weapons, are exclusive to online play as well. Even worse - as this has gone on, the file size of the install has increased to match it (and you cannot install single player only) - it was around 50GB when I first got it, and now sits at 110GB. This game could be amazing to play offline, but Rockstar are fixated on herding players into their online mode in order to milk them for cash.",331.6,0,0

"The prices you've applied to Turkey seem like a joke. As a country, we didn't switch to the dollar; Steam switched to the dollar to keep prices stable in Turkey and prevent constant fluctuations. What you should have done was convert the price you applied to us into dollars. In other words, the price would have remained the same, and we would have purchased it in dollars. This was what Steam communicated to us. Despite knowing our low purchasing power, you would never make sales at these prices. You can't manipulate Turkish gamers in this way. Good luck. Türkiye'ye uyguladığınız fiyatlar adeta bir şaka gibi. Ülke olarak, biz dolar sistemine geçmedik; Steam, Türkiye'de fiyatları sabit tutmak ve sürekli dalgalanmayı önlemek için dolara geçti. Yapmanız gereken şey, bize uyguladığınız fiyatı dolara çevirmekti. Yani fiyat aynı olacaktı, sadece dolar olarak satın alacaktık. Bu, Steam'in bize ilettiği bilgiydi. Düşük alım gücümüzü bilmenize rağmen, bu fiyatlarla asla satış yapmazsınız. Türk oyuncularını bu şekilde manipüle edemezsiniz. İyi şanslar.",405.1,2,0

the game is better than playing it on consoles. you can play online for free which i totally like and you can use mods for cars and servers which in certain standards is cool. i recommend this game to many people who love to play gta v online or have not tried online yet and wants to give it a go.,64.9,0,1

"TLDR: Great game, worth it for $15. -Graphics 8.2/10 -Story 8/10 -Freedom 9.6/10 -Capitalism 13/10 As always, it's GTA so of course it will be nearly perfect in the realm of RPG/Action/Adventure games. It's a huge AAA title, so it's going to have some bugs, even 10 years or more after release, but that doesn't detract from the perfection that is the GTA series. There's a reason it's one of the most well-known RPG games on the market. I haven't experienced anything game breaking from playing it on Xbox 360, Xbox One, Series X and now PC. It's well worth it for $15 during the Autumn Steam Sale, but I don't see myself paying $30 or $50 for the game + DLC content/money shark cards. Just buy the ""premium"" edition for $15 and spend a day or two grinding in online mode if you want the $4m from the shark card, save that cash!",58.1,0,1

"Hello, viewers! This is my review of Rockstar Games' Grand Theft Auto V ! Table of Contents This is the order in which I will go over certain aspects of the game: Story GTA Online Modding Community The story of is so masterfully crafted, I don't know where to start! The story from start to finish is AMAZING, much like story. The only thing that makes story a tiny bit better is the fact that the story never really gets repetitive, which was my only gripe with story. The fact that there's 3 main characters, all with different backstories and fully fleshed out is amazing as well! In this sub-chapter, I'm going to discuss the endings of the games, so if you don't want spoilers, the rest will be blacked out using the spoilers feature. on PC is very dangerous to play at the moment due to hackers and IP grabbers, however the console version (Xbox One, PS4, Xbox Series X|S and PS5) is really fun to play with friends. However public lobbies are not worth going into, because in my experience, getting griefed every 10 seconds by a level 1000 gets annoying after a while. The modding community for PC is amazing. There's many fun mods out there to play, my favorite being which is one of the most popular mods of all time. There's another mod named which is also popular amongst Twitch streamers. There's multiple ways to mod and manipulate the game and I suggest doing that once you've beat the story mode. This game, in my humble and honest opinion, is the SECOND best game, the first being (if that wasn't obvious already). However if I were to rate the game on a scale from 1/10, I'd give it a 8.5/10 (due to the Online mode being unplayable on PC and somewhat unpleasant on console). Anyways, if you enjoyed reading this lengthy review, please leave a like saying the review was helpful! Also I hope this review helped you make your decision on whether or not you wanted to buy this game!",51.1,1,1

"Due to Take Two Interactive the franchise is going down the drain. Take Two Initiative has set down most of the major mods that have supported the game, if you are thinking that you want to play things like zombies for example, it is no longer working with modders leaving and retiring. Rockstar has been putting anti-modding programs together to shut down the modding community while at the same time saying ""we support modding"" while being responsible for shutting down the modding platform for GTA. A lot of people are going to have to be fired because they are actively bringing the company down as shown by their actions contradicting their words.",115.0,0,0

"This is a little late but I can't believe how bad this game has become. Everything's pay-to-play. Shark cards are expensive as hell despite the game originally costing like €50. Even if you have enough money to buy vehicles, you're not allowed to buy them until you fulfill some garbage prerequisite. This game is nothing but a money maker for Rockstar and it's just utter trash. If you want to just have fun and not get killed by randos you have to play FiveM. Hackers are STILL a rampant issue but god forbid you get money from one cause you'll be punished for it. Trying to join up on friends online the game constantly errors out and kicks you back into single player or different server. While trying to run, if you happen to accidentally go too near to a mission or whatever, it'll take you into the mission without you wanting to and leaving it trying to get out of it kicks you out of the server sometimes. Thanks for turning this game into absolute garbage, Rockstar. I've always loved the series but you have officially made this entirely unplayable. GTA6 is going to look great and seem like a good idea but I know it's going to the same nonsense but more expensive. I hate this game with every fiber in my being.",262.3,0,0
"Story mode is great obviously, but online is a sh*t show. Cheaters in literally every single lobby, multiple cheaters, who will go out of their way to ruin your day, terrorize you until you're forced to leave. Cheaters will also disconnect you from online, crash your game, etc. There is almost no reason to grind for cash as you can just have some skank ass modder give you money, or you could just buy a mod menu. You literally cannot report people who are cheating, as the cheaters can intercept these reports and even see who filed a report and then subsequently crash your game. Screw R* for allowing this cheating epidemic to just run rampant. It just baffles me how R* can neglect such a large portion of their player base, what a sh*tty developer. Shame on you R*.",105.8,8,0

"Grand Theft Auto is a series of action-adventure games created by David Jones and Mike Dailly.[2] Later titles were developed under the oversight of brothers Dan and Sam Houser, Leslie Benzies and Aaron Garbut. It is primarily developed by British development house Rockstar North (formerly DMA Design), and published by its American parent company, Rockstar Games. The name of the series is a term for motor vehicle theft in the United States. Gameplay focuses on an open world where the player can complete missions to progress an overall story, as well as engage in various side activities. Most of the gameplay revolves around driving and shooting, with occasional role-playing and stealth elements. The series also has elements of the earlier beat 'em up games from the 16-bit era. The games in the Grand Theft Auto series are set in fictional locales modelled after real-life cities, at various points in time from the early 1960s to the 2010s. The original game's map encompassed three cities—Liberty City (based on New York City), San Andreas (based on San Francisco),[a] and Vice City (based on Miami)—but later titles tend to focus on a single setting and expand upon the original three locales. Each game in the series centres on different respective protagonist who attempts to rise through the criminal underworld due to various motives, often accompanying themes of betrayal. Several film and music veterans have voiced characters in the games, including Ray Liotta, Dennis Hopper, Samuel L. Jackson, William Fichtner, James Woods, Debbie Harry, Axl Rose and Peter Fonda.[3] DMA Design began the series in 1997, with the release of the Grand Theft Auto. As of 2020, the series consists of seven standalone titles and four expansion packs. The third main title, Grand Theft Auto III, released in 2001, is considered a landmark game, and brought the series into a three-dimensional environment for the first time. Subsequent titles have followed and built upon the format established by Grand Theft Auto III, receiving significant acclaim. The games influenced other open-world games, and led to the label Grand Theft Auto clone on similar titles.[4] The series has been critically acclaimed, with all the main 3D entries in the franchise frequently ranked among the greatest and best-selling video games;[5] it has shipped more than 405 million units, making it one of the best-selling video game franchises. In 2006, Grand Theft Auto was featured in a list of British design icons in the Great British Design Quest organised by the BBC and the Design Museum.[6] In 2013, The Telegraph ranked Grand Theft Auto among Britain's most successful exports.[7] The series has also been controversial for its adult nature and violent themes, as well as for cut content.",38.0,1,1

"English: Homemade Landjäger Sausage Ingredients: - 500 g beef - 500 g pork - 20 g curing salt (nitrite curing salt) - 5 g coarse ground pepper - 5 g sweet paprika - 3 g garlic powder - 2 g ginger powder - 2 g dried marjoram - 1 g ground coriander - 1 g grated nutmeg - 1 g ground cardamom - Pork casings for stuffing - Kitchen twine Instructions: 1. Cut the beef and pork into small pieces and pass them through a meat grinder with a coarse plate. 2. Place the ground meat in a large bowl and add all the spices (curing salt, pepper, paprika, garlic powder, ginger powder, marjoram, coriander, nutmeg, and cardamom). Mix well until the spices are evenly distributed. 3. Cover the meat mixture and let it rest in the refrigerator for at least 24 hours to allow the flavors to develop. 4. Thoroughly clean the pork casings and soak them in cold water to soften. 5. Remove the meat mixture from the refrigerator and knead it again to ensure proper blending. 6. Stuff the meat mixture into the prepared pork casings, ensuring there are no air pockets and that the casings are evenly filled. 7. Cut the filled casings into approximately 10 cm long pieces and tie the ends with kitchen twine. 8. Hang the Landjäger sausages in a cool place to dry for about 2-3 weeks. The ideal temperature is around 15-18 degrees Celsius. 9. After the drying period, the Landjäger sausages are ready to be consumed. They can be enjoyed raw or lightly pan-fried. Note: When making sausage, it is important to maintain proper hygiene. Ensure all utensils are thoroughly cleaned, and use fresh meat. It is also recommended to familiarize yourself with basic sausage-making principles and consider employing specific sausage-making techniques. German: Selbstgemachte Landjäger Wurst Zutaten: - 500 g Rindfleisch - 500 g Schweinefleisch - 20 g Nitritpökelsalz - 5 g Pfeffer, grob gemahlen - 5 g Paprika, edelsüß - 3 g Knoblauchpulver - 2 g Ingwerpulver - 2 g Majoran, getrocknet - 1 g Koriander, gemahlen - 1 g Muskatnuss, gerieben - 1 g Kardamom, gemahlen - Schweinedärme zum Abfüllen - Küchengarn Zubereitung: 1. Das Rind- und Schweinefleisch in kleine Stücke schneiden und anschließend durch den Fleischwolf mit grober Scheibe drehen. 2. Das gewolfte Fleisch in eine große Schüssel geben und alle Gewürze (Nitritpökelsalz, Pfeffer, Paprika, Knoblauchpulver, Ingwerpulver, Majoran, Koriander, Muskatnuss und Kardamom) hinzufügen. Gut vermengen, bis die Gewürze gleichmäßig verteilt sind. 3. Die Fleischmasse abgedeckt für mindestens 24 Stunden im Kühlschrank ruhen lassen, damit sich die Aromen entfalten können. 4. Die Schweinedärme gründlich reinigen und in kaltem Wasser einweichen, um sie geschmeidig zu machen. 5. Die Fleischmasse aus dem Kühlschrank nehmen und erneut gut durchkneten. 6. Nun den Fleischteig in die vorbereiteten Schweinedärme füllen. Dabei darauf achten, dass keine Luftblasen entstehen und der Darm gut gefüllt ist. 7. Die gefüllten Därme in etwa 10 cm lange Stücke schneiden und die Enden mit Küchengarn verschließen. 8. Die Landjäger für ca. 2-3 Wochen an einem kühlen Ort zum Trocknen aufhängen. Die ideale Temperatur liegt bei etwa 15-18 Grad Celsius. 9. Nach der Trocknungszeit sind die Landjäger bereit zum Verzehr. Sie können roh gegessen werden oder kurz in einer Pfanne gebraten werden. Hinweis: Bei der Herstellung von Wurst ist es wichtig, auf hygienische Standards zu achten. Sämtliche Utensilien sollten gründlich gereinigt und das Fleisch frisch sein. Es empfiehlt sich außerdem, sich mit den Grundlagen der Wurstherstellung vertraut zu machen und gegebenenfalls auf spezielle Wurstherstellungstechniken zurückzugreifen. Chinese: 自制兰德亚格香肠 材料： - 500克牛肉 - 500克猪肉 - 20克食盐（亚硝酸盐食盐） - 5克粗磨黑胡椒 - 5克甜辣椒粉 - 3克大蒜粉 - 2克姜粉 - 2克干马郁兰 - 1克芫荽粉 - 1克磨碎肉豆蔻 - 1克磨碎草果 - 猪肠衣（用于填充） - 厨房绳 制作方法： 1. 将牛肉和猪肉切成小块，然后通过带有粗孔板的绞肉机绞碎。 2. 将绞碎的肉放入一个大碗中，加入所有的香料（食盐、黑胡椒、甜辣椒粉、大蒜粉、姜粉、马郁兰、芫荽粉、肉豆蔻和草果）。充分搅拌，使香料均匀分布。 3. 盖上碗，放入冰箱中静置至少24小时，使香味融合。 4. 彻底清洁猪肠衣，并将其浸泡在冷水中软化。 5. 从冰箱中取出肉馅，再次揉捏均匀。 6. 将肉馅填入准备好的猪肠衣中，确保没有气泡并且填充均匀。 7. 将填充好的猪肠衣切成约10厘米长的小段，用厨房绳扎紧两端。 8. 将兰德亚格香肠挂在凉爽的地方晾干约2-3周，理想温度为摄氏15-18度。 9. 干燥期结束后，兰德亚格香肠即可食用。可以生食或轻微煎炒。 注意：制作香肠时，保持良好的卫生非常重要。确保所有器具彻底清洁，并使用新鲜的肉类。还建议熟悉基本的制香肠原则，并考虑采用特定的制香肠技巧。",187.7,1,1

"Grass is a type of plant with narrow leaves growing from the base. Their appearance as a common plant was in the mid-Cretaceous period. There are 12,000 species now.[3] A common kind of grass is used to cover the ground in places such as lawns and parks. Grass is usually the color green. That is because they are wind-pollinated rather than insect-pollinated, so they do not have to attract insects. Green is the best colour for photosynthesis. Grasslands such as savannah and prairie where grasses are dominant cover 40.5% of the land area of the Earth, except Greenland and Antarctica.[4] Grasses are monocotyledon herbaceous plants. They include the ""grass"" of the family Poaceae, which are called grass by ordinary people. This family is also called the Gramineae, and includes some of the sedges (Cyperaceae) and the rushes (Juncaceae).[5] These three families are not very closely related, though all of them belong to clades in the order Poales. They are similar adaptations to a similar life-style. With about 780 genera and about 12,000 species,[3] the Poaceae is the fifth-largest plant family. Only the Asteraceae, Orchidaceae, Fabaceae and Rubiaceae have more species.[6] The true grasses include cereals, bamboo and the grasses of lawns (turf) and grassland. Uses for graminoids include food (as grain, shoots or rhizomes), drink (beer, whisky), pasture for livestock, thatch, paper, fuel, clothing, insulation, construction, sports turf, basket weaving and many others. Many grasses are short, but some grasses can grow tall, such as bamboo. Plants from the grass family can grow in many places and make grasslands, including areas which are very arid or cold. There are several other plants that look similar to grass and are referred to as such, but are not members of the grass family. These plants include rushes, reeds, papyrus and water chestnut. Seagrass is a monocot in the order Alismatales. Grasses are an important food for many animals, such as deer, buffalo, cattle, mice, grasshoppers, caterpillars and many other grazers. Unlike other plants, grasses grow from the bottom, so when animals eat grass they usually do not destroy the part that grows.[7] This is a part of why the plants are successful. Without grass, soil may wash away into rivers (erosion).",15.0,0,1

the HQ thing is awful to play MW2 you load MW3 then you have to need to scroll to the bottom and then select MW2 multiplayer then you have to wait for the game to load then update and restart if there is one and then you can select what game mode you what. and if there's a update for MW3 then you have to update even if you only have MW2 so a 80+ GB update become its cheaper and looks better for players stats as discord and steam-DB think your playing MW3 and it does not help that i have a ♥♥♥♥ internet connection of 3MB/s.,113.3,0,0

"1,500 hours in and I still enjoy MWII. I'm close to completing the Weapons Master challenge (for 51 weapons, 100 kills with gold camo, 200 kills with silver camo, 300 kills with polyatomic camo, and 400 kills with orion camo). I mostly played shipment or hardcore (domination, hardpoint, ffa). Some things about MWII that I liked: I really liked the Tier 1 mode. I thought it was an improvement on hardcore more. Unfortunately the community disagreed and they replaced it with regular hardcore from previous CODs. DMZ was a blast to play. I enjoyed the PvE and PvP aspect of it. I just wish they didn't reset the challenges after the beta. Some of the challenges were a real grind to get at required you to have a well coordinate group. I hope they keep DMZ around in future CODs (it's not in MWIII unfortunately). I wish I played DMZ more, but it was so hard to find a good group of people to play with when searching for randoms. However, once that good group was found, the game mode was a blast. For MWIII: I like the it's a little faster paced than MWII. I still mostly play hardcore. I'm absolutely not going to grind for camos like I did in MWII. I just won't have the time this upcoming year to grind, and some of the challenges for the camos seem frustrating. I'm really happy they implemented the Carry Forward feature for the skins and weapons from MWII. I spent an embarrassing amount of money on skins in MWII (probably over $200), so I'm really happy I can use the same skins for another year. I won't be spending much money on skins in MWIII. I'll probably only buy the first battlepass as the battlepass grind has gotten out of hand. It takes too long to go from 0 to 100 and I ain't got the time anymore. I initially didn't like MWIII after the 1,500 hours of MWII, but it's starting to grow on me.",1531.4,0,1

"Ah, Call of Duty: Warzone, the game that turns ordinary folks into tactical warriors (or not-so-tactical warriors, in my case) after 13 hours of gameplay. My journey through Verdansk has been nothing short of a rollercoaster ride... with more respawns than I care to admit. Let's start with my highlights: I've mastered the art of parachuting straight into enemy fire, I've found creative ways to confuse my teammates with my impeccable communication skills (or lack thereof), and oh, the number of times I've mistaken a bush for an enemy! Stealth level: Zero. My strategy? Well, it's a well-kept secret. Some might call it bold and daring; others might say it's more akin to a headless chicken running around the battlefield. But hey, who needs a plan when you can blindly charge into combat, right? Speaking of combat, I've discovered that my aim can be best described as ""stormtrooper-level accuracy."" The number of times I've fired a whole clip and still managed to miss my target is a skill in itself. I've become a pro at giving opponents a fighting chance... by being the least threatening player on the field. Now, teamwork? Let's just say I've redefined the meaning of ""friendly fire."" Sorry, teammates! My trigger finger gets a little too excited sometimes, and my strategic grenade throws have a habit of finding their way to the most inconvenient places. But all jokes aside, despite my questionable skills and countless mishaps, Warzone has been an absolute blast. The adrenaline rush of those final circle moments, the hilarious banter with friends, and the pure chaos of it all make those 13 hours a whirlwind of entertainment. If you're looking for a game where you can laugh at yourself as much as you compete, Warzone is definitely the place to be.",13.5,0,1

"SERVER & NETWORK ISSUES - do not purchase until COD can get their servers and network issue corrected. Disconnected from servers three times today while playing Zombies, losing all gear every disconnect. Tried multiplayer, disconnected or Profile Signed Out three times in the middle of a match. Playing a Private Match with friends and I was disconnected, all players kicked, with the message ""Host Kicked you from Server."" I was the host/creator of the Private Match, how do you get kicked by the host when you are the host.... If you like DMZ or Zombies, do not purchase. Losing all of your gear after hours and/or days of accumulating good gear because of Server Disconnect or Profile Signed out is frustrating and unacceptable from a name as big as COD. Zombies sessions can become laggy when one player uses a LT53 Kazimir ""Black Hole"" grenade. Game play is good but frustrating to attempt to play. COD makes Ubisoft look good.",383.9,0,0
"Is it a 70 dollar DLC? Yes. But over all the game feels a lot better then MW2 2022. I Played the OG MW2 back in the day and it is a trip down memory lane playing these maps again with friends. Mulitplayer for the most part feels really good. My biggest complaint about this game though is that some of the guns feel SUPER spongey when trying to kill some one. But movement is nice and smooth. CoD just needs to fix there UI and stop making us feel like we have to load 3 seperate games when it comes to loading multiplayer, story, zombies and WZ. I probably am not the only out there that says they need to make warzone its own game and stop including it on downloads with there current games.",67.7,0,1

"This is one of the only games some of my friends play, so I'm kinda forced to buy it every year. Tried telling them to try other things, but they don't seem to care. If you're buying this for the campaign or zombies; steer clear. They're both dogwater. Campaign was rushed due to Activision false advertising last year that MW2 would be the last CoD for many years, and then rushing this out. It's not the developers fault. Activision wants to milk the absolute hell out of this to keep making people spend money on microtransactions that are all over this stuff, and in some regards; making the game pay-to-win. The Zombies is just outbreak, but even more barren and lacking any real content. I do quite like the multiplayer. Never been someone who cares about K/D or competitive, and I'll take SBMM over always being thrown into tryhard lobbies like I did back in the older CoD's. The movement and gunplay is about like MW2019 which is by far the best the gunplay has been in my opinion, period; as a person who has played all of them from MW2-Bo2, and then returned for MW2019. It's just so fluid and fast and just like I want it. The problems just come into play with the pre-gameplay experience. UI is a complete mess. Takes forever to get into the multiplayer menu and even then its so ludicrously convoluted. I have no idea why they changed it from the vertical panel menu that Modern Warfare 2019 had. Apparently this is MWIII ran in MWII's launcher which is kind of ridiculous, but I mean, with how rushed this is; it's very easy to see why. Another big issue is that the shaders have to recompile literally every time that the game opens. Also that it updates very frequently like MW2019 did; prompting me to constantly restart. These were issues in MW2019, and they still appear to be completely unfixed. It's a bug they know about, and Activision has not told the developers to do anything about it. Rush a game; then not do ♥♥♥♥ all about the minute things they need to fix. I really do not get it. Why can't you just; release one game, refine it, and then once it's fully set up properly; then you can just move onto developing the other, using the framework you built, and the bugs ironed out? Obviously we live in a world where a lot of developers are just forced to rush games out, and because a new game is already being worked on once one is released; they must divert all their attention to developing the new game, and maintaining online content for the current one, but is it really THAT hard for companies to just; release ONE game and support it exclusively for a year or two while it's refined, and THEN work on the next game after those two years are up? I don't get how this is such a difficult concept. I have no hope that this will be rectified when Microsoft acquires this game. Take some lessons from Forza Horizon 5; that game is supported for a long time, and while it has its own problems; at least it gets care put into it. Obviously this is not worth the money. Some people are gonna have a hard time avoiding this game since they have friends who play it and/or streamers especially often can't just stop playing their most popular game. Obviously that's why these companies do not care. It sucks there's not more ♥♥♥♥ going into Government interventions, as it's obvious ♥♥♥♥ like this is terrible for consumers. Might be preaching to a void, and contributing to the problem, but holy ♥♥♥♥ I'm tired of this. EDIT: Played a little bit more, and holy ♥♥♥♥; I'm so far behind others, because apparently MW2 levels carry over, and I did not play MW2 at all. So unfortunately; everyone else just automatically has good weapons with attachments right out of the gate, and I'm stuck with weapons that have severe recoil and do not really work well. I admit I'm ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ at this game and only had around a .90 KD or so on MW2019 (Which I bet is largely because I played Shipment and nothing else). This game is not very fun. Also the SBMM is really setting in, and it feels like I'm playing against people well above my skill level. Not blaming other players. I am ass at this game. It's the fault of the algorithms. I wish you could just toggle a setting to turn SBMM on and off, just at least so I can test it out. Or at least give us a game mode to just.. casually play the game please. The way it stands; I'm refunding this game. It's not worth $70 at all.",1.2,1,0

"the multiplayer we got in mw3 is not what majority of players wanted and it does not live up to their promise. the game still has ridiculously fast ttk because 150 health is a flat out lie when all guns consistently deal more damage compared to mw1&2. the game poorly rewards accurate players coz the majority of weapon damage profiles don't differentiate arms & torso / head & neck shots which practically means bigger player hit box. awful perk changes and balancing like the ""removal"" of high alert. movement is the only thing that's returned to us but it no longer shines like it did in mw1 due to the terrible changes mentioned above. I suppose this is also why a lot of people been reporting instances of insta kills(tho it might also have something to do with server tick rate). at this point im just convinced they're forever unable to make another game as good as mw2019",32.9,0,0

"Don't play this game. It is a rage fest in which you will get way to mad way to often, and have way too little fun. But why does this happen, you ask? Because the developers make money off of broken guns, skins, and other items. They publish purchaseable blueprints and sell the skins for cod points. Ex. Lockwood shotgun, which they intentionally made one shot (broken) 2 weeks before they released a bundle for it. This meant that anyone struggling to level it, or loving abusing it would buy the blueprint and it would get even worse. But who hurts?

"Mixed Feelings on COD MW3: A Steam User's Perspective Review: Call of Duty: Modern Warfare 3 (COD MW3) on Steam presents a mixed bag of exhilarating experiences and frustrating issues. Let's break it down: Pros: Open World Zombies: The open-world zombies mode in COD MW3 is a thrilling highlight. The game offers a rich blend of missions and unlockables that keep you engaged for hours. However, once you've completed all the missions and unlocked everything, the replay value diminishes significantly. Extensive Arsenal and Customization: A major plus is the vast selection of weapons, camos, attachments, characters, and skins. Impressively, these elements are carried over from previous COD games, offering a sense of continuity and reward for long-time fans. Quality of Life Improvements: The developers deserve praise for their commitment to improving the game. Frequent bug fixes and updates show a dedication to enhancing the player experience. Cons: Persistent Party Bug for Steam Users: A significant drawback for Steam players is a bug preventing them from joining other players' parties. This issue, unique to the Steam platform and absent on , has persisted since the game's release without a resolution. It's a known issue, widely reported, yet frustratingly unresolved. Ongoing Minor Bugs: The game suffers from various small bugs that impact gameplay. For instance, there was a week-long issue where players couldn't save any gun with the Golden Enigma camo. Although this particular bug has been fixed, the presence of these glitches can be annoying. In summary, COD MW3 on Steam offers a robust and enjoyable gaming experience, especially with its open-world zombies and extensive customization options. However, the enjoyment is marred by persistent bugs, particularly the party-joining issue for Steam users, which remains a significant frustration. The game shines in many areas but could benefit from more attentive bug resolution to provide a smoother experience.",162.0,0,0

Why do I have to launch a separate launcher through Steam, restart since it somehow needs an update every day, launch the game I intended to launch, restart IT for ANOTHER update, then get served adds for bundles and battlepasses before I can finally just get in a match????

"This game saved my marriage. I'm not big on shooters because I'm bad at them, and I've tried playing things like WZ or DMZ and I just didn't enjoy them because, well, I'm bad. My partner, however, loves shooters and I slowly started resenting them fow how much time he would spend playing games, starting at big animated b00bas, and talking to anime uwu girls online. With the release of MW3 and Zombies, I've now been able to play a more PVE aspect that allows me to be bad but also not die 20 seconds in so I can actually enjoy the game. He still sleeps on the couch, but at least we can spend more time together and when I hear some anime chick trying to UWU his ears off I can use voice to screech like a banshee and then recite the Curse of Ra in a distorted, demonically possessed voice.",78.4,0,1

modern warfare 2 is hated on so much idk why it was so much better than vanguard overall and had a better multiplayer than cold war. It also actually made the game realistic and not take 20 mags just to kill one person. the campaign for mw2 was great as well and had amazing graphics. mw3 on the other hand is hot ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. multiplayer is just mw2019 all over again and the campaign was the worst part. It is so obvious that mw3 was supposed to be a dlc but activision just needs all the money in the world to make a ♥♥♥♥ game. overall buy mw2 not mw3,544.5,0,1

Finally a good CoD after years. Was top 25 world wide in Black Ops 4 after I quit and this game really wakes me up again. 8/10 would recommend. -2 P because of SBMM which they adress soon and remove fully by the end of the year.,119.8,0,1
"For the love of mercy, please remove SBMM. This game 75% of the time feels rigged. You'll be doing great, and all of a sudden you get packet bursts out of nowhere and your bullets do absolutely nothing. The enemy team rubber-bands your team like a 2nd place car in a racing game and the score will either have your team losing or barely winning a nail biter. There's no in-between lol. I've seen people leave in real time on the enemy team and all of a sudden i'm going against people that arent even human. These players are turned up on steroids (activision bots) and everyone on my team is getting one shot killed, but we have to empty entire magazines into the enemy team. You don't play the game because this game plays you. It's rigged to make everyone suck and buy store bundles lol. I just play to grind camo's because i'll never break a 1 KD again in any COD title post Black Ops 4 lol. It's not a defeatist attitude in giving up, but I'm being completely honest and realistic. I'm also 35 and my reflexes aren't sharp like my 20s lol. Just grind your camo's and go for weapon and armory unlocks. Leave the high KD goals to the Cronus Zen streamers that are paid by Twitch/Youtube/Activision or the sweats that have daily hours to burn playing this, because they're pretty much unemployed lol.

BAD game all around. Trying to find one thing that I think functions correctly has been impossible. Need to be rank 25 to unluck guns ok get there and then you need to do daily quest. Then some of the quest need you to be rank 45 in order to do. It just a ♥♥♥♥♥ trying to keep you riding it all day. Sound is horrible/Movement horrible/smoothness worseeeeeee. 2019 is what I am coming from and plays 100 percent better than this pile of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and that is with SBMM pushing my connection do the deepest depths of space and time on both games. There is no awareness sound is just sound with half the players being dead silent. You can turn off sound and I'm sure perform better on the smaller maps anyways. Tried to return game after just looking at it for a few minutes realizing it is still lower quality than what I would be coming from but sure enough they will not let you it piles playing time from the free to play warzone from cod 2 last year to this one then says you have played more than the two hours you are allotted. Probably could have really gone at it to return but that is on STEAM for being a pile of ♥♥♥♥ as well. Tried 3 times and then said ♥♥♥♥ it... so note that if you have any time on call of duty 2 you will not be able to return. UI is horrible and boggy as you move around. Game is visually very unappealing and cartoonish. I've tried settings high/low/middle just feels like connection is not at all correct match to match. I feel like people cant see me half the time and vice versa. Playing and I spawn in to die over and over being preshot not sure what that is all about but then next round is fine. Like playing against hard bots with total map awareness. If it was a cd I would probably break it in half and enjoy that more than the game. Should have kept skipping them but will attempt a few minutes here and there with friends as long as they tough it out only reason I bought knowing SBMM was bad. Time for a new game and developer to step in and pick up the slack.,18.3,0,0

"For the amount of time I have spent on the game there are issues. Separate your games. It is impossible to get all the achievements unless I own all the games under the title. For a triple A game company, I shouldn't be reporting 10+ issues within the first two weeks (not to mention how bad steam and activision support is). This game has a lot of bugs and glitches that relatively get patched quickly, but in turn some times hinder your gameplay - ex. MWZ, the zombies for MWIII, has a lack of zombies funny enough. In a game where I expect to kill thousands and have a problem staying alive, I would be lucky to see hundreds (600+) and to cap it off, they nerf your EXP if you kill more than 750 zombies. They made the exfil super easy after they realized people could just farm it over and over again. It's just not exciting and I hope they have plans to bring round based zombies with Easter eggs back into the game. $70 is the biggest ripoff. You shouldn't expect so many things wrong with the game. Also I have heard many people complain this is just a DLC for MWII which I can see. Like... why are these guns in the game? I only got 36 guns in this game wtf? Yes, I understand I can unlock the MWII weapons without purchasing the game, but its ridiculous how bad they are too. Anyway.. This and EA games are the scam of the century.",119.3,0,0

I was wrong, the games got worse and worse. Every game they buffed player health more and more. Now you're lucky to get 3 kills with a single 30 round mag. MW 2019 was golden then they nerfed movement and ads times and quickscope. Basically everything that made cod fun once before is now gone.

The multiplayer's gameplay feels improved from MW2 but it feels way more chaotic and hard compared to MWI and MW2.

This game is so trash for a large developer. So many bugs on release not to mention that you cant play with friends and its a mission in itself to figure out how to play with friends because the game is so broken. The spawns dont work at all you literally spawn in front of other players and they spawn people right behind you. Not to mention everyone just camps and cheats in the game plus there are so many guns that need to be nerfed. This game is straight trash call of duty is dead im never buying another one. Plus the zombies mode is garbage its not balanced at all and just flat out sucks. Zombies can you hit you from 20 meters away it makes zero sense. You also can only go in with a party of 3 dumb af.,76.9,0,0
"Honestly, this game sucks. You are permanently slowed in multiplayer because every grenade, explosive, or some bullet has slowing abilities. It is extremely frustrating. We can then go to spawns... more than half the maps are from a game 10 years ago, you know what still sucks? The spawns. I have spawned with my gun facing the back of an enemy 10 feet away dozens of times, and the same has happened with them spawning behind me. If you're playing on M&KB just forget it. The controller users will win most gun fights because their gun follows your head. So prepare to spend hours practicing your aiming so you can have fun and not lose every gunfight. Oh, if you want to have fun for multiple games in a row, DO NOT HAVE A GOOD GAME AND POP OFF! If you pop off, your next 3+ games will bump your SBMM so high it feels like you're playing a different game. Lastly, if you have friends with a higher SBMM, forget having fun. You won't.

MW3 for me is not enjoyable at all i cant even describe how much i hate it, there is that much wrong with it. surely i could go into a massive rant about everything wrong with it. The fact that activision pushed this mess of a game instead of allowing infinity ward to continue anything else is appalling (i heard infinity ward talked about making advanced warfare 2 which activision said no) but everything aside ♥♥♥♥ this game ──────▄▌▐▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▌ ───▄▄██▌█ BEEP BEEP ▄▄▄▌▐██▌█ +1 Negative Review ███████▌█▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▄▌ ▀(⊙)▀▀▀▀▀▀▀(⊙)(⊙)▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀▀(⊙)⠀⠀⠀⠀",79.4,0,0

It's CoD. Pros: General game play is solid and not too buggy. Cons: -Visualize and graphics feel blurry all the time no matter what you try to change. It makes it feel like trash and in a fast paced FPS where you need to see enemies that sucks -Movement feels clunky -Kill-streaks are unrewarding and too easy to take down -Feels like a reskin of the last MW game -Seems like most of the dev effort is going towards the BR modes and not normal multiplayer. It's losing what I played CoD for.,72.5,1,0

"Negative review is for MW3 primarily but theres some aspects that cross over due to the nature of release. This game shouldnt exist, literally shouldnt legally speaking. There was a clear and cut ""this will be the only entry for a couple of years"" for MW2 and you bastards couldnt keep your word for even a year, you saying that and turning around to release WITHIN A YEAR is a fraudulent marketing tactic and deserves to be seen and judged as such. Activision/Blizzard apparently hadnt failed enough this year with its steam releases so you released a $70 ""new"" game that adds all of a 4 hour campaign... a worse customization system... and (what I presume will be) a mediocre zombies mode. With $70 being the new price for ""AAA"" games its laughably not worth it (hell in my opinion its not worth $20), only reason why people are buying it is either ignorance or brand loyalty or a combination of both (if its through loyalty... please end that loyalty now) which is NOT how this should now or ever work. I hate that Activision was bought by microsoft cause it has reached the point in its life that it needs to work... or die, with the purchase that will not happen and microsoft becomes an even larger monopolistic (which theyve been proven to be in violation of anti trust law before) company that will preserve this garbage till they become no longer sustainable. Problem with not letting something die is you make it a husk of a shell that has no identity/purpose for existence but will be made anyway despite unanimous hatred and vilification just because they have no idea what else to do. The Too Long Didnt Read Abridged Version Is: 70 dollars for this pile of ♥♥♥♥ is 60 dollars too much given the lack of content and problems with its existence.",428.2,0,0

Awful player skins are in the game, like we have Alucard running around its all sorts of cursed and maps are just ported from the original MW2 with a face job and that's it.

"If you're reading reviews to make an informed decision on whether you want to buy the game or not, please keep in mind that the CoD community Is up there among the most toxic, impossible communities. No one has their own opinion anymore. They all parrot the things they hear their friends, favorite players, or streamers say in moments of rage when they're not dominating lobbies every time they touch the game. This game really is a $70 DLC. And I understand just as well as anyone, how much it sucks to live in a world where cash is king, and everything is driven by greed. But that's what we've got to work with. If you want to buy the game and play it, DO IT. Stop letting others influence, and decide for you. If the game runs fine, and is populated, then it's interpretation should be unique to the user. This is a negative aspect of Review systems. Everyone has an opinion, but most of those opinions you hear and read today belong to imbeciles.",149.4,1,1

"This review will primarily be based around Modern Warfare III, and it's ""Search and Destroy"" game mode. Many of the maps are re-implemented from previous CoD instalments, which sounds cool, however, many of these maps over implement advanced movement and verticality to every surface known to man. You can climb just about everything, from trees, to buildings, to cliffs, to heavy machinery, not to mention all of the new pixel angles and otherwise implemented via the new models, which provides players with near instant spawn peaks, and a million plus angles to worry about while traversing the map. Which in of itself isn't terrible, I can get over it. Although, the real issue comes in when discussing the new equipment item, the ""covert shoes"" which make all movement related sounds literally, and completely silent (even tactical sprinting through bogs of water), removing all audio feedback from the player, making it a near game of luck when turning a corner. Furthermore, due to the inability to hear players, the best strategies revolve sprinting around the map, and if you dare stop, the odds are your enemy hasn't and will find you from any of the 12 sight lines toward your current position, making death frustrating as in many circumstances it is not reasonably possible for a player to clear all sight lines before proceeding, or before being spotted through the use of another sight line and or pixel angle, and or being ran up to from behind by a literally silent opponent wearing an equipment item of which is not particularly fun to obtain. Which brings us to the next topic, the grind. Just about every CoD game has had some serious grinding, which isn't an intrinsically negative aspect. However, for even the process of unlocking just about any item of equipment (equipment referring to any item that provides an impact on the game play experience, for example a weapon) requires a ridiculous amount of silly daily challenges such as getting 2 slide kills while in ""tactical stance"" in 3 separate matches, and at the time of writing, the challenges are bugged most of the time and simply cannot be completed, requiring you to wait another real life day before trying again. Now, the most disappointing part of all, Zombies, it's meh... It's like DMZ from MWII but Zombies, it's not bad, not great. I didn't personally have a great time playing it, so do not expect a classic Zombies experience. In my opinion this is the worst CoD ever released, somehow worse than advanced warfare. I was excited for this game as I thoroughly enjoyed the previous two instalments. Even more so considering the massive improvement between them. This game had immense potential coming from the foundation of MWII however the designers decided to rip up the foundation, and throw away many of the principles and otherwise that made MWII fun, and replace it with so many new ridiculous features, from maps to equipment. 3/10. Buy this game on a heavy sale, or wait for the next CoD.",136.7,0,0

"I can't help but feel a sense of nostalgia about Call of Duty: Modern Warfare III. Sure, the game has seen its fair share of criticism, but for me and my dad, it's a trip down memory lane that's absolutely priceless. Back in the Xbox 360 days, we spent countless hours engrossed in the original Modern Warfare 2 and Modern Warfare 3, and this latest installment brings back all those cherished memories. Despite the divided opinions, I find myself thoroughly enjoying the game. The familiar maps, the intense firefights, and the adrenaline-pumping action are like a virtual time machine. It's not just a game; it's a connection to the past, a shared experience with my dad that spans years. Modern Warfare III might not be everyone's cup of tea, but for those of us who remember the sheer joy of those early COD days, this installment is a heartfelt salute to the roots of the franchise. It's more than pixels on a screen; it's a bond, a story, and a testament to the enduring magic of the Modern Warfare series.",7.9,1,1
"Product received for free As a Disclaimer, this game absolutely is a ripoff of DLC being charged for $70. The campaign is actually terrible and everything in every mode is very noticeably thrown together out of as many spare parts as could be found to put a game together, so if you're hesitant to pick this up then save your money. This is the game we were supposed to get last year and it's stupid of Activision to give it to us under a new price tag for a game that just reverts a lot of IW's stupid changes in last year's game. With that said, I'm actually surprised how much better this game plays and feels over last year's entry. Sledgehammer I've always believed are the kings of feedback and they really took MW2 and refined it to a razor's edge with MUCH faster and more fluid movement that reminds me so much of Titanfall. It feels so nimble and snappy and complimenting them are the guns with fantastic feedback (audio, time to kill, recoil feel, etc.) that make this one of the most punchy and satisfying CoD's in a while. Zombies also works surprisingly well as a DMZ spinoff, even if it could use a lot of refinement. It's a chill mode to grind guns outside of MP's sweatfest, promotes cooperative play and scavenging, then once you get into Contracts, they remind me a lot of Cold War's Outbreak with plenty of other neat ideas thrown in. It's not a whole lot right now and needs some tweaks to match times, gear progression, optimization with Squad Fills and permanent loot solutions, but what's here is still fun and engaging if you're interested in DMZ and/or Cold War's Outbreak mode. In summary, the MP is incredibly fun with an engaging gear unlock mechanic (which magically, somehow, convinced the CoD community to play objectives for a change), the Zombies is different but chill, unique, and even engaging with a lot of promise ahead, but the campaign is a real stinker and not worth your time. If you really wanna play this MP I strongly recommend waiting for a deep sale or waiting until you try the updates to Warzone to see if the new mechanics justify it enough personally for you for a purchase. Zombies I'd give it a season update or two before considering it.",108.2,0,1

"One of the worst FPS multiplayer games I have ever played. While some of the gameplay and unlocks can be extremely enjoyable it will never shadow over the unending number of unnecessary mechanics and microtransactions littering this once respected franchise. The amount of obscure unlock conditions or disgustingly out of touch skins is honestly headache inducing. Let me mention a few mechanics that completely ruin this games multiplayer integrity due to how abusable they are. • Sliding • Sliding with full momentum after half a foot of sprint, • gun mounting • full unchecked gun customization • full ADS control while dropping prone • dropshotting • covert boots - a piece of equipment that eliminates all player noise made from movement • player movement speed (I am not kidding they can move 25mph in full tactical gear) • knifing coupled with ludicrous strafing and movement speed • Strafe speed despite ADS'ing • tactical grenade spamming • slide cancelling • Corner flyouts All these things listed are in the game because the developers have zero vision. Thus, the game is an amalgamation of player wants and demands across years and years of COD. All these different wants from all these different fans, so much mixed reception has led Call of Duty into being such a mess of design. An absolute cash cow that you should only play if you have no respect for yourself.",30.8,1,0

I have some advice for any game devs out there.

"I love Call of Duty. I've played it since Call of Duty 2 and Call of Duty 4. I've always been a PC player with Keyboard and Mouse input. Ever since Modern Warfare 2019 and the much needed engine upgrade to Call of duty, I feel Call of Duty has been worth playing again. Its fun and its addicting when you are having a good time and everything is patched and working. But Modern Warfare 3 is everything wrong with Call of Duty and its sad decline in terms of fun, the game working as intended and a company who is getting greedier and greedier, failing to realise why people are giving them negative feedback even when the game is playable. Its down to broken promises, failure to listen to community feedback and opinion and pure incompetence and greed. Modern Warfare 3 is what Modern Warfare 2 should have been in the first place. When it comes to the Multiplayer, it is fun and works when it works. They fixed most issues and problems that were present in Modern Warfare 2 that Infinity Ward refused to listen too or remedy. This shows on my Steam account because after around 30 hours at launch of MW2 before Season 1 even occurred, I stopped playing MW2 2022 for good and didn't play it again. The big problem people have (me included) is it feels like you are paying full price ($70) for a DLC patch that basically fixed MW2 2022 into a state of what it should have already been anyway. This rubs a lot of people the wrong way. The multiplayer is given poor reviews and is often said to be terrible. In reality, the Multiplayer is decent and feels like MW2019 again in terms of fun, but once again Modern Warfare 3 suffers from a new studio (Sledgehammer Games) who say they are listening to the community but it feels like they really aren't at all and are doing what they think is right or best instead. I will outline the Pros and Cons of this game below: Pros - Multiplayer works well and is a step up from MW2 2022 but needs more content from new seasons to feel worth it once again - Zombies DMZ mode is really good and fun and a laid back way to level up guns and earn battle pass exp if you are getting frustrated from multiplayer games and trying to level guns with no attachments (can be extremely frustrating trust me) - The game runs very well on PC. I get 120+ FPS on High settings. I only have the game hard crash maybe once every few days at best. Stability in performance seems to be there if you have a good PC. (I use a Intel CPU and 6700 XT GPU and play at 1440p with the game installed on a NVME SSD) - The developers add playlist updates often and based off what the community wants or prefers. Its something I guess which is a positive. Cons -SBMM or Skill Based Match Making or ""Algorithm matchmaking"" is still present in this game. Despite extreme community feedback about SBMM and seeing it either removed or changed so people aren't as frustrated by it so they can have fun, it seems the developers ignore any mention of SBMM feedback and refuse to say anything about it or how they can address the community about SBMM. This is rather saddening. Battlefield games and other FPS don't have such harsh SBMM like COD or none present at all. - Campaign is very lazy and was probably rushed. Most Campaign missions use DMZ maps and assets and play the same way. ""Go here"" or ""collect a key card, open a door, go here to finish"". Extremely disappointing conclusion to the MW2019/MW2/MW3 storyline. - No Crossplay on PC to play with only Keyboard and Mouse input players. This is something that was present in MW2019 and Cold War (from Treyarch). It was even in the MW3 open beta itself. But it seems it was removed at launch of MW3 and the devs have said they don't intend to allow PC players to only match with other PC players via input. This is very disappointing to me as a PC only player. - Some MW3 guns are useless and others are completely broken or busted. If you don't use what is considered ""meta weapons"" = you are at a huge disadvantage and will do poorer in games because of it. In the original MW2 2009 and MW3 2011, the guns were balanced very well and every gun was a 2-3 hit kill and yeah some were slightly better or worse, but you could use any gun in those games and do well (a gun meta was there back then but not as impactful as modern cod games). Also there was no SBMM in the past so you could have fun with any gun. This is no longer the case. - MW2 2022 guns that carried over into MW3 have not been updated stats/damage wise for MW3 and its 150 HP values. This means most if not all MW2 2022 guns which were not changed to accommodate MW3s increased HP values means that they often take more bullets and longer to kill enemies than MW3 guns. This is a huge con and a big issue to me because it leaves almost half of your weapon arsenal ""useless"" in multiplayer. There is no point using a gun like the MW2 2022 3 round burst M16 if you like it because it takes longer to kill targets than the MW3 3 round burst weapons and you're basically handicapping yourself. It seems the developers have no plans to update the MW2 guns stats for MW3 either. This is bad. - The game doesn't feel like a full priced COD game experience and just feels like a MW2 2022 DLC fully priced. I am enjoying the game a lot myself, but I cannot ignore the negatives. Its a wait for a 30-50% sale and maybe in Season 2 or 3 when the games updated or fixed, then yes, it would be worth it. Final thoughts: I just wish Call of Duty went the live service free to play route of Fortnite or Apex Legends. They could have one game thats free for everyone on all platforms and continue to build upon it forever and add seasonal content and operator skins and blueprint skins endlessly and I feel that would turn around their negative feedback they receive online at the moment. I don't think they ever will do this though sadly. The game is also anti fun with how extreme the SBMM is. Call of duty should be about fun and about enjoyment first. I feel this has gone down a lot over the years and its Activisions own fault, not ours.",204.6,2,0

They suck MW3 REVIEW Easily the worst game in the series. Bad campaign that only last 3 hours, decent multiplayer, and good zombies just not executed that well. DO NOT BUY THIS GAME.

"A week ago i was diagnosed with a terminal illness and the doctors have given me a year at best. I'm so glad i was able to play this before i go.

If you read thank you and good bye.",9.3,2,1
"honestly a great game, but the campaign is definitely too short. Honestly is a 8/10, just because of the campaign length. I loved the freedom that the open-combat missions gave me (hey they tried somethin new, and it worked out great imo) Multiplayer is hella fun, although I do hate the arsenal, its dumb asf. Zombies is real fun, and I like the freedom of it as well (just maybe add some new maps to it or somethin?) I've been waiting for MWZ to come around since i first played MW 2019, but I just wish it had that classic zombies feel, yk? anyways, I would recommend this game for any die-hard COD fans, and don't get butthurt because they ""cHanGED the TimElINE"" its a video game ffs and its nice to have some new stuff.

Yeah there are cosmetics but it's like every time I go to the store there is the Oni again but in another costume. How many Oni cosmetics do we need in a row? Every new character or like bundle is $20 and don't forget your battlepass that is like what? Another $20? Guest characters are in the game sure, but like in the others it still was like a costume for a certain operator. Argue Snoop being in the other Call of Duty games and it doesn't make sense, but we have Ash, Spawn, character's from Diablo, THE BOYS, and several other rappers. Again, they had cosmetics that didn't make sense but now they are just trying things. I hate to say that I was a fan of this series and I was hoping that MW3 was gonna be fun. But now I think, damn... can we like ask for a refund for a game DLC that is added to what is now the Call of Duty launcher?

"I've been playing Call of Duty for a long time, the movement and the guns feel great in this game, but I have to literally work to have an OK game in this one. Whatever kind of SBMM they use in this game is killing the experience for me. After working all day, the last thing I want is to be forced into lobbies that feel like ranked matches. There is no reward for getting better at the game it feels like. Was always close to a 2kd in past titles, this one I'm at a 1.3, but my point is that the matches feel robotic and fixed. It doesn't feel like an organic experience, rivalries can't be made still in this title due to disbanding lobbies, and it just sucks the fun right out of it. I wish the devs would listen to the community and tone down the SBMM. You're going to lose another long time player of this franchise. Would I recommend? If you're new to the game, it could be fun until you get better at aiming and with movement and learn the spawns(which are broken rn), when that happens you'll be forced to play matches that feel like ranked and are sweaty as can be, over, and over, and over again... be warned. SBMM is like this in this game: Playing well the first minute of the match, all is fine. Then, they spawn someone right behind you to give them a kill even though it makes no sense because your team holds the side of the map that you're on... really crazy to be honest. That is just one of many things wrong with their SBMM system. I'll finally be moving on to a new game, because I don't have the time to sweat my butt off learning how to beat a new matchmaking system that is geared towards making me lose. I've done it the past three titles, and I'm over it. I'm not a pro by any means, but I'm also not a scrub, and it's bonkers that this is how it is. It's just not fun anymore for me. Thanks for all the great COD titles in the past, this one is it for me....",886.7,1,0
"$70 is outrageous for a video game, especially this piece of ❤️❤️❤️❤️. Whatever idiot decided MWII, MWIII, and WZII belong in a single launcher is a special kind of stupid.

"I know EOMM is in this, cause the game was great when I first bought it. Great enough I shilled for the season pass, and the second that I bought it, I had roughly 5 good games.

The sloppy work the team put in on zombies copy and pasting buildings is an insult as well as not giving us round based zombies like what we all love. Instead they just added zombies to a warzone map with a couple of extra steps. Multiplayer is ok at best, the element of 'banter' is now gone where nobody takes offence is now removed on search and destroy. I'm sure they would look at 99% of comms at the end games where banter has been throughout and they would hear the sincere respect from both teams. Instead they decided to protect kids who are playing the game WHO SHOULD NOT BE PLAYING THE GAME!! Hacking, don't even get me started. My first game had a hacker in it.

dont get me wrong the game is good but activision doesnt condense their files so it takes a butt ton on space to download. Also even being hard wired games drop and lose connection every other game and you cant progress on the zombie maps.

"sbmm ruins games. no i don't want to beat up on noobs. i want to have consistent connections and not a lobby full of carbon copies of me. zombies is absolute crap solo. always crashing and loosing gear. no offline zombies mode, no roundbased. they insist you play zombies with 23 others, the game cant handle many zombies per player, so it never really spawns more than 20-40 at once. no more high round trains or killing hundreds at once with a cool trap. they released a beta for $70, so many bugs. I could go on and on, but i wouldn't care about any of it if multiplayer was connection based again.",109.2,3,0

"One launcher for all the games sounds good right? Nope huge updates that means friends with slower connections have to wait hours or just not play at all. I have had the game update 3 times in a row on a few occasions when i have finished a match and had to reset and also means streamlabs wont recognise COD for a while. Always fun mid stream. You open COD HQ to play MW2 Multiplayer for it to have to restart and then go into MW2, just so many steps through janky menus please just have a separate launcher and stop trying to monetise it to oblivion . After every update menus feel heavy and sluggish, pretty much constant shader optimisation constantly because it updates so often (I assume for the latest game breaking pay to win skin) I love call of duty, I love the franchise even with all its bad bits but it just feels like i'm watching it die slowly as it becomes more and more like some mobile game. If that's what you want make it all free to play no a full priced game. That been said I will probably keep buying them and hoping it get better feeding the cycle.",497.1,2,0

So my partner and I have played several of the COD games together. Me enjoying zombies the most (partially because if I suck I don't resort to blaming others from anger lol). This game overall has made me very happy in just the time since the beta and its official release. Especially the open-world zombies map. Having more things to explore and do other than being confined to such a small area is honestly a breath of fresh air. Definitely recommend even the older players who haven't touched a COD game in a while to get this and play.,201.4,0,1

"I love playing with friends, this is why I play the game, I enjoy MP however, I do not recommend this game. It is MWII without DMZ, Arguably the best mode in Modern Warfare, we are getting Warzone soon, but this is usually very sweaty and not as fun as DMZ. Zombies is Rubbish. Really boring, not as exciting as Zombies from other instalments, but Zombies was never my thing anyway. So they took away a fun mode, added a bad one, that is a mash up of both but not as good as either. The balancing has been a problem with guns acting very strangely. Pistols beating SMGs in close range, Assault rifles beating SMGs in close range, beating Marksman rifles in long range, and everything in-between, there is little reason to run anything other than an Assault rifle. Hardly any new maps... Basically this is an overpriced expansion to MWII, which you pay full game cost for... Instead, get MWII enjoy DMZ, you get a longer campaign and more epic campaign, if you reeeeeally wanna find out what happens in the campaign you can get MWIII but yeah don't expect much more.",476.8,2,0
"MW3 REVIEW Very good campaign, the story was very nice and i liked the flow when the campaign tells itself through the missions. However, i feel like the campaign was very rushed and quick. Overall id rate the campaign a 7.5/10. The state of multiplayer is in a very bad position as well as zombies. Its not about the quality, the quality exceeded my expectations, its the game servers that ruin it for me. Very laggy and stutters alot and overall its not a good experience (and yes ive tried everything to fix the issue and it doesn't solve it at all). The gameplay itself however is nice and i love the game modes included. The only reason zombies and multiplayer isnt that great at all, is (like i said) because of the laggy servers. It slightly ruins the motivation to keep playing and i hope in the future this issue is fully solved. MP and MWZ = 5.5/10. Overall, MW3 is a pretty solid game, but it definitely has A TON of room for improvements. Overall my MW3 (zombies, campaign, multiplayer) rating is 7/10.",40.1,0,1

"Let's go ahead and get straight to it. Does this feel like a copy and paste from last year's MW2? Yes. Straight out, yes. Does it feel like they purposely held back from releasing maps from MW2 so they could include them in MW3? Kind of. We will never know for sure. However, if the original MW2 was your absolute favorite and you loved playing on those maps, then MW3 is worth picking up. I am not going to focus my review on the negatives. You can clearly see, from the current number of negative reviews (as of 11/23/23) on Steam, this game does have its faults. I didn't buy this game for the short campaign or zombie modes. I bought it specifically to go back and essentially play the original MW2 maps, with current COD mechanics. AND IT IS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT! Don't get me wrong, there are problems, but the overall experience is what I am enjoying. There will be matches where you completely dominate, but then others where you are the one getting dominated. It happens. Does it ruin the overall experience for me? No. Believe it or not, the movement has been improved from last year's MW2 as well. Being able to slide-cancel is fantastic and the overall movement feels as smooth as ever. Map voting is back too. A small, but welcome feature. Gun mechanics and weapon customization is a straight copy and paste from MW2, but is that a bad thing? Not necessarily because if ain't broke, don't fix it. Now, if you hated the weapon customization from MW2, you will hate it here too. It is what it is. Overall, I have enjoyed my time with MW3 multiplayer and love returning to the ""new"" old maps. I look forward to the future of this specific iteration of COD and hope the developers are actively listening to the complaints people have so they can improve the experience. Cheers!",183.7,0,1

"MW3 is a good game.All the fleck it gets for just being a re-skin is unwarranted. Literally every call of duty is a re-skin of its predecessor. Just because they finally made the decision to make your PAID cosmetics move over doesn't mean they didn't put work in their game. Multiplayer is a blast with more guns then ever.Yes they were carried over but i don't know a single person who wouldn't want to have black ops 2 weapons in black ops 3 with additional new weapons.I hope to see this kind of carry over stuff more in the future.Also I've been asking for these map remakes since the original mw3. Really enjoy this one. But i also need to say that this campaign is one of the baddest ever.Vanguard still is worse for me. Zombies is also thresh.I don't know who at these call of duty studios thought that round based zombies was bad because that person needs to be fired.Its basicly DMZ but with zombies thrown in. I can tell you that if you like cod multiplayer you will have fun with this one.If your a zombies fan ,you best buy black ops 3 still.And if you only play cod for the campaign you should already be used to burn your money because there are much better single player campaign kind of games that tell better story's then cod.

I quit cod 20 years ago thought i would try since i left when the 1rst black ops came out mw2 was done. cod doesnt monitor hackers they dont adjust to a new player. now they have a new method they put hacks in the options and thatv justifies hacking now. by far the worst franchise on hackers. u see if u get destroyed by hackers they make money. u get pissed buy a bigger gun still loose and they get the money without providing the service they promise. plus there gonna money grab a game a year i bid ado and will never spend another cent on anything activision or affiliated partners. ps why r they bringing in woke rainbows as chalk art in middle of a war map. look no 1 cares gay whatever is there we dont care why would u do gay ♥♥♥♥ in the middle of a warzone.

"I love the CoD franchise but for ♥♥♥♥'s sake, MW3 actually sucks. I get nostalgia, but the maps are not designed well for the modern movement, game play and resolutions. the reason the maps worked so well back then was because the highest quality at that time was possibly 1080p, but most played on 720p, which works because you would need a scope to actually see across the map but now you can kill someone across the map with any gun because people can play on 1440 to 4K, you can spot a single pixel from someone's model from across the entire map. Every map practically plays like Rust/Shipment due to how the modern game play is. This game truly sucks, map designs are not good anymore, they need to bring back the maps from MW2 remake to give variety (though they should bring maps back from MW 2019 also tbh, those were good too)",487.1,1,0

"I literally vowed to never purchase the game. My buddy was playing and I wanted to surprise him. We played about 10 matches. The first 6 went smooth. It was actually really fun. I had about a 2.5 kd at this point. The 7th was a bear to get through but I went about even. The 8th was where I really noticed my guns had gotten weaker and the enemies bullets had gotten way stronger. I was getting 2-shot and dying, even though the game was saying I was hit with 5 hits. Meanwhile, I was unloading half a clip into the enemy team and still getting dropped. Not a skill issue. It's a game issue. BullSh** . I had the lowest ping in the lobby too so it's not about my connection. No, this is influenced by the Activision/Blizzard/Microsoft to hurt the player if they start doing too well.

"MW2 is great but MW3 is a huge waist of money. First pc connection issues are more prominent then console making console have a huge advantage and half of all throwing knives that should hit will clip through people. Second it should not take half a mag to kill people. The game makes everyone tanks and if it weren't for that the connection issues would have been fine. For now stick to mw2 until they fix the tanks they call soldiers, if they even fix it.",129.5,0,0

"Product refunded In the adrenaline-soaked annals of interactive warfare, Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3 emerges as a chaotic masterpiece that transcends the very essence of traditional first-person shooter experiences. Developed by the mad alchemists at Infinity Ward, this instalment catapults players into a maelstrom of military mayhem that oscillates between the sublime and the utterly nonsensical. Graphically, Modern Warfare 3 is a visual feast, with explosions that rival the intensity of a supernova and textures so hyper-realistic, I could almost feel the digital wind ruffling Captain Price's meticulously rendered beard. The sheer granularity of the bullet casings hitting the ground added a layer of authenticity that transcended the boundaries of virtual reality and flirted with the surreal. The audio design is a symphony of chaos, a cacophony of gunfire and explosions that would make Beethoven question his life choices. The thunderous roar of automatic weapons, the percussive rhythm of grenades, and the haunting echoes of distant warfare create a sensory experience that is both exhilarating and disorienting. It's as if the sound engineers went on a bender, drowning in a sea of war-themed dubstep and emerged with an auditory masterpiece. The campaign narrative, while ostensibly coherent, takes an unexpected detour into the realms of existential absurdity. Characters with the gravitas of Shakespearean actors deliver lines that oscillate between profound military strategy and the musings of a caffeinated conspiracy theorist. The plot, like a Jackson Pollock painting, is a splatter of disjointed events that somehow coalesce into a semblance of coherence, only to unravel into a tapestry of bewildering inanity. Mission objectives range from the strategic and tactical to the downright bizarre. One moment, you're executing precision airstrikes on enemy positions; the next, you find yourself engaged in an epic firefight against an army of sentient soda machines hell-bent on global carbonation domination. The boundaries between reality and fever dream blur as you navigate through urban landscapes that inexplicably transform into psychedelic discotheques, complete with neon-lit tanks and break dancing enemy soldiers. As the campaign hurtles toward its climax, the narrative dissolves into a surreal fever dream. Captain Price reveals himself to be a time-travelling bard, armed with a sniper rifle that doubles as a lute. The antagonist turns out to be a misunderstood thespian seeking recognition for his avant-garde interpretative dance performances. The final mission involves a dance-off to determine the fate of the world, with the fate of humanity hanging in the balance of a rhythmic showdown. In the end, as the credits roll, you're left questioning whether you just experienced a brilliant satire on the absurdities of modern warfare or if the entire game was an elaborate hallucination induced by an overdose of Mountain Dew and military-themed interpretative dance. Call of Duty Modern Warfare 3, a tour de force that blurs the line between genius and insanity, leaves players with a sense of bewildered satisfaction that transcends the boundaries of conventional gaming experiences.",0.3,1,1

So many small things -AI monitored chat system... I guess other games are trying it to, but know your player base, come on -$70... It's the principle, rising game prices but same quality of games, make it worth it, hash out some bugs prior to the game (instead of a million hot-fixes that forces me to update and restart my game every day I log in) It's fun, I'd say I would be happier to have bought this a few months in once it's a well-worn game, but I am content with my purchase.",59.6,0,0
The last call of duty i will ever purchase i think. Zombies is not fun in my opinion. Im glad they brought back the OG mw2 maps but there is no new maps currently. They require your personal phone number to play online which is really sketchy to me. Thats a pretty personal thing to ask for a game. I get server disconnected message far too often and i have great internet so its not on me. It sucks playing a whole match just to be kicked near the end. The campaign is extremely short. The game is basically just an expansion of the previous game. I was really hoping they'd make the sniper glint more realistic but unfortunately not. Cod has just become so involved. The best cod games were simple. Im just let down almost every time ive purchased one because they feel the need to do too much. I honestly feel stupid for buying it. i do not recommend.,47.5,0,0

"MW3 is just a poorly balanced, $70 DLC for MW2. Not worth it. Extra health to all players make you unload an entire pistol clip into any enemy for one kill. All the new maps are HUGE, making it a grueling sniper fest that makes it hard to use any closer range weapon - including AR's, the most common gun type. Unlocking things is horrible, the daily requirements sometimes resulting in you not making any unlock progress for that day due to you not having the item you're supposed to kill with. The sole good thing about this is that the grenade launcher was added to the normal launchers, which should be in MW2 as it's already in MW2 gun game.",395.8,0,0

MW3 Is a phenomenal game from the get go. People who haven't bought this game can still download it at no additional cost. If its one thing I give Activision credit for its for their generosity and commitment to release a quality game deserving of your hard earned cash. The geniuses at Sledgehammer games are up around the clock to bring you store content UPDATES everyday which attests to the consumer-first attitude they have at their studio. I found myself overwhelmed with the choices i have in choosing which skins to buy. I ended up buying the Exotic Tracer Pack which I myself think was a good choice. BUY NOW!,189.3,0,1
"When was the last time a video game made you question whether or not what the characters are doing, what you are doing, is right? In Modern Warfare (2019), Infinity Ward shocked the world with its new reality driven campaign, in which the world feels like it has real consequences in it. Modern Warfare II (2022) does everything in it's power to undo this. It takes what was a very grounded and almost disturbing military experience and puts it back into the regular action packed military painted nonsense that comes out every other time. The campaign is alright, it just pales in comparison to it's predecessor. Not one moment in the game had me think about my actions, made me get on the edge of my seat or made me want more because it was stuff I had all seen before. Even the rehashed bits from the previous MW felt disingenuous. Not only that, I have to access MWIII (2023), a game I don't own, in order to gain access to MW2. That is a problem. I wanted to play the campaign again and had to close everything and relaunch MW3, to get to campaign menu for MW2... So yeah, just get Modern Warfare (2019) now that they don't force you to download Warzone Caldera anymore.",17.2,0,0

"I can say get it for the MWZ yeah it is not like the old zombies but I like that I can go in grind weapons get cool looking skins for doing said grind, you do not have to que with randoms you can just solo party, do side missions, revive randoms and not invite them to party and enjoy 45 minutes of open world zombies. while trying to get to the final boss of the zone. Wait for a sale on it but if you want the DMZ experience without the cheaters waiting for ya at the extraction zone to steal your loot and ruin your day this is a better experience with a similar system.",374.2,1,1
I am 17 years old I am about to be a teenage father in 3 weeks. I decided that I wanted to get back into call of duty. So I decided to take a risk on spending $70 on a new cod so I could enjoy it before my son was born. THIS IS THE WORST RISK BETTER YET WORST $74.50 I HAVE EVER SPENT IN MY ENTIRE LIFE.

"This is a review of how to launch and navigate the UI of Call of Duty MW3 or apparently just ""Call of Duty"". There is one launcher that incorporates all 3 remastered Modern Warfare games. Yet when you go in to try and launch them you have to navigate the puzzle of a UI and the game reloads itself like 5 times before you get in to MW3. Then, It somehow always gives me an advertisement to buy MW3 which is the game I am literally playing already. Then once you're in its the worst UI of all time. Then good luck figuring out what to click to get into anything. I cannot figure out how to see the different modes of multiplayer the game has. When I first tried to play zombies with my friend I couldn't figure out how to find the start game button. Good luck if you ever want to figure out where the menu is to customize your guns. If you want to try and find the settings for anything good luck. I don't think the game wants you to play it, this is the worst UI of all time. As far as the actual game goes, I really am only interested in the Zombies mode, and honestly, though I was skeptical, its pretty fun for what it is. It could definitely use tweaks but its fun.",16.6,0,0

Thanks Activision, this is a great experience from my last cod since Ghosts",74.5,0,0
Honestly most the reviews that you will see are just people sitting on the hate bandwagon and probably actually like the game but the popular consensus is the game is bad so they can't go against it. Now for some actual criticism: The campaign is dogwater the campaign for Destiny 2 somehow felt longer and more happened in it than this campaign. Really the campaign is a DLC. Multiplayer ain't too bad most of the matches I get are pretty normal call of duty happenings. The TTK increases the skill barrier for the game as it takes longer to kill other players so you can't just rely on a meta gun to win the battle. Zombies is by far the best addition I actually enjoy it tho I wish they didn't nerf exfils. I understand people were exploiting them for xp but it was fun to actually have a crap ton of zombies come at you as you try to escape in the helicopter and doing it in more difficult areas made it a decent challenge. Also I would love it if they implemented a item protection for internet disconnections to the zombies as it really sucks to be playing and lose everything due to lag or latency. Overall not a terrible game definitely Midtier - Good needs improvements but literally every other triple A release does too. (Don't buy it expecting something other than a modern Call of duty shooter cause that is just ignorant),53.2,0,1
"multiplayer is unplayable, packet loss/ packet burst makes it lag like heck. since i played the single player missions before they released the multiplayer i wont be able to request a refund. and i couldn't anyways since they piggybacked this game off there mw2 loader so the keep the player numbers and hours high.",211.4,3,0

Still perfect to play with friends and enjoy all the old MW2 glory days. However, I do agree that this game feels like an expansion to the most recent MW2 and not necessarily a new game, and definitely shouldn't have a normal price either. It would be worth 39,99€ in my opinion and everybody would be much happier, and it would have more sales for sure.

"I will admit I am in the fringe minority in that I don't like Multiplayer and buy games like Battlefield and CoD strictly for single player campaigns and stuff like bot matches and instant action. That said, Battlefield V has one of the saddest campaigns out there. The very first mission makes the campaign feel like it'll have big 'battlefield moments' and this never happens in play. Campaign 1 was by far the weakest being just very weak stealth sections with a challenge that made me realize the keyboard controls for the planes is probably the worst KB+M flight controls ever made. Campaign 2's missions dragged almost as much as Campaign 1's and makes me wonder why they decided to front load two campaigns of generic stealth segments and wide open three objective maps. Campaign 3 was actually enjoyable and felt like an actual battlefield campaign. Campaign 4 was the most interesting deciding to be nearly strictly in a tank with only two brief on foot section. It also had the most interesting character dynamics and moral questions raised. Had the previous three campaigns been remade to that quality it probably would have lead to a better experience. I got it on sale for 5.86 CDN and honestly I think the campaign is just BARELY worth that price. I've played bargain bin FPS games that gripped me more than BFV's campaign did.",5.0,2,0

"This game is amazing, although it has a few flaws. I personally recommend this game, 𝐏𝐑𝐎𝐒: 1. Amazing graphics 2. Destructible walls and barriers 3. You can build sandbag walls, turrets and other heavy weapons as a support, barbed wire, and a few more. 4. Amazing guns 5. Good customizations for the guns 6. Great variety of vehicles for the Japanese, American, British, and German sides 7. Destruction is very rarely randomized by AI. Most of what you see is made by a player and looks randomized. The only randomized destruction you'll see it outside of the battlefield which you barely notice. 8. Easter eggs! 9. Revival mechanics that allow you to ask for help or skip the revive. Unlike Battlefield 1, you aren't just a limp corpse, you actually have an animation and can look around with your hand outstretched while asking for help. You also have different lines depending on whether you are fighting for the Germans, British, American, or Japanese.",263.3,2,1

"Let's get it started. +Incredibly beautiful. The game looks amazing, I'm not sure I've ever seen anything like this in a shooter. I had a very strong desire to set the settings to ultra and just walk around the maps on empty servers to look at this beauty. The developers' attention to detail has always been at a high level. +Specializations. The mechanics have been updated and the perks are now immediately available, but the game is still most effective in a squad, which is a plus as it's fun. The classes have been redesigned and are now better and more balanced. +Minor new mechanics and reworked old mechanics. First aid kits, ammo, supply boxes, the ability to revive a squad member, and rewards for squad points are done very well and fit into the gameplay. The absence of an actual wallhack when spotting, as in BF4, is also a big plus. +Official servers. No more sh!tty rules from stupid admins, no more permanent bans for politely telling the admins why their rules are sh!tty. It's amazing that there are no class restrictions, no nukes, no rebalancing and other idiotic things. We can just play the way we like. =Squad. Playing in a squad with friends is just as damn fun and highly effective as playing with random people in your squad is boring and unproductive. +/-Recon class. This has become much more useful. You can now spot enemies in an area with the Flare Gun and when hit. Why isn't this a real plus? The fact is that the Battlefield games have a recon class and no sniper class, which does not give us the opportunity to get the classic sniper experience. Killсam will always shows your position when you kill somebody and your rifle will never kill with a single shot on a body. +/-Maps. As I said earlier, appearance is amazing. But there are few of them and many of them are unbalanced and boring. +/-HUD settings. It's just as customizable as in BF4, but now we're finally spared from the disgusting battlelog, and we can directly join a friend without any problems. This should be in games by default so it is not a really plus and in this case DICE fixed their mistakes. -Cheaters. The official servers have only one problem - the lack of human moderation and/or a kick voting system. The anti-cheat system does not work here at all, and a couple of years ago EA initiated the free giveaway of an unlimited number of copies of the game through Amazon. As a result, even if the cheaters is banned, they can easily buy a new account on third-party sites for a very small price, or perhaps they have already created a dozen accounts for himself during that giveaway. This is a huge problem, in about half of all matches you will encounter a cheater. If you suspect cheating, but you are not sure whether to send a report, I recommend checking the player's nickname on the bfvhackers website. -Balance. Unfortunately, traditionally everything is very bad. Incredible high rate of fire + good control of some types of weapons (Type 2A, etc.), automatic shotguns (several oneshots per second), DMR, prone playstyle with a machine gun - huge advantages. The aircraft have been made even more powerful and you will die from them a lot, the situation is much worse than in BF4, because here they mainly attack infantry. DICE don't know what balance is and this game is no exception. The biggest cons. -Gadget keys. At critical moments, they may simply not work literally up to a minute. This doesn't happen often, but it's very frustrating because the game simply won't let you use your first kit. -Unlocking. Not only are newcomers forced to compete with more experienced players, but they don’t even have specializations for weapons from the start and they have to unlock them. The stupidest trend and I have no idea why all shooters have this annoying thing. -No test range. BF4 had a great test range where you could set up settings and adjust your classes. The test range in BF5 is terrible. You can't set up classes and test them, and there aren't enough interactions to fine-tune HUD and other things. -Community. It's disgusting here too. The developers deliberately added imbalanced weapons to retain the casual audience, but the garbage community here plays almost with such weapons only. -Censorship. EA suppresses free speech all the time but this is truly a new level, I have never seen anything like this. Now the chat has a censor and some of your words will be replaced with ""***"". FC U EA. You are trash. -Support. DICE and EA don't care about their products. There is no chance that any of the above will be fixed. I must admit that this is quite an entertaining product. If you have even one person willing to share multiplayer gameplay with you, I highly recommend it. BF5 is vastly superior to BF4 in almost every way. But the fact is that both of these games have common cons that are most important to the gameplay. A good gaming experience is a consequence of playing cooperatively with friends, and not the merit of the game itself. Therefore, playing alone is very uninteresting, boring and annoying due to the imbalance. Verdict. Objectively the game is very bad. Terrible balance and community, lots of cheaters - are the main cons that make the game unplayable. However, playing in a squad can keep you here for a while. I'd like the game to get a few patches, but since no one cares about it, I wish it dead. The ""Not Recommended"" was given because the game doesn't deserve the 70% positive reviews it has on Steam.

"It's not bad, but it's also not great because it has 1 annoying bug (i.e. sometimes you can't switch the weapon and you need to pick up another or restart) and the campaign is too short - it's a pity because the existing missions are nice, but it seems they didn't give a damn about developing more stories. 7.2/10",9.6,0,1
"I have about 500+ hours on PS with this game, before I 'migrated' over to PC. If anything, I think this games tale is unfortunate. It had some neat innovation regarding gameplay, like Squad-leader reinforcements and that infamous V-1, movement mechanics that not many people know about, like pressing crouch before hitting the ground when falling a moderate distance to do a combat roll to nullify fall damage, the fact that if you string sniper headshots, your characters starts counting past the third kill, the interesting weapon upgrade tree and tons more, yet it still was mostly a fart in the wind. The bar was already high in the wake of BF1 with this game, and due to terrible marketing among other blatant factors, they ♥♥♥♥ the bed since that infamous day the horrid trailer released. People on twitter can twist it any way they like, the 'diversity' inclusion of women in ALL factions is more insulting to the role of women during the Second World war then totally leaving them out. They could have had women during a 1945 Germany as Volksturm or the multiple woman battalions the Red Army had, even maybe be creative with a Resistance faction (and not just the French). Speaking of which, the fact they cut out the Red Army in development when they ceased game support, (Evident by the fact that they once accidentally had an experimental soviet machine gun in the shooting range, the LAD, 2 years ago) was the biggest missed opportunity ever. Especially because the dedicated '''''''''''DEVELOPMENT''''''''''' time for BF2042 was practically for nothing. How fun would it have been to run around with a PPsh-41 in this game? Blast people with a T-34? Play with a Panther on the Wehrmacht on a map like Kursk? Have one of the Squad-leader reinforcements be a Nebelwerfer/Katyusha strike? Have the Special tank for the soviets be a KV-2? Dogfight Bf109s with Yak-9s? Have the Red Army scream their iconic war cry when they advance as attackers during Breakthrough? A Battle of Stalingrad? Moscow? An Operation with these? Maybe even lesser known fronts like the Lapland Pocket or the Siege of Königsberg? Even the Battle of Berlin with King Tigers and IS-2s? It could have been the greatest ♥♥♥♥ ever! Instead we got a launch with stupid politics, a director that said a line of utter meme worthy proportions, who got himself fired within two months of launch, a hacker problem of mythical scale with bugger all offical regulation, the LATE inclusion of community servers and the IDIOTIC decision to make them free, inclusion of Women in the Wehrmacht, the US Army, the Royal Army as well as the the Imperial Japanese Army, that is historically inaccurate and during a time when gamers were getting sick of identity-politics and a later Battlefield game that only recently got player-numbers back because they put the game down to 10 bucks. Let this be a cautionary tale and hope for better things. Thanks for coming to my TET talk. Oh you want to know if you should get the game? Uhhh..... Wait for a sale like you always should, dumbass.",4.9,1,1

"I truly believe that the Battlefield franchise was a criminally underrated series based on what it had to offer in comparison to other games and franchise of this genre. Battlefield V might have been the last truly great entry in the franchise and I firmly believe it is one of, if not the best. Battlefield V may not have been the most historically accurate game, but the gameplay, the maps and especially the audio made it extremely difficult not to be immersed in the setting the game takes place in. The game only gets better when you play with friends, but the comradery you can find in any teammate when trying to achieve a common goal makes every match an experience like no other. Too many hackers tho",38.4,0,1
"In my opinion the best Battlefield, if we are talking about graphics, detalization, amount of modes and so on. Here is not so hard to do a kill, as is in BF1, where you can play only on communtiy servers, where a majority of player will not leave you any chance to kill them.

"its okay, pretty lackluster for a battlefield experience. the definitive edition gives you all the weapons + there is hardly any equipment so there is not a lot to grind for in this game. cheaters are common and there are next to no private servers unlike other battlefields. the lack of an addition of the red army/any soviet campaign is also pretty disappointing, so no mosin, ppsh, or svt. the game goes on sale for $10, and i would say its worth it for that price, the graphics hold up well and if you can look past the historical inaccuracies its pretty fun, but if you want a true battlefield experience i would go with 4 or 1",6.1,0,0

"This game is still holding up really well. It ain't no run and gun game, so if you're looking for that kind of BF game, check out BF1 and BF2042. Battlefield 5 plays fairly more tactical and you're going to use covers a lot. Unlike games that take an aracade-ish approach, in BF5, a .22 caliber to the head from half a mile sends you back to the deployment screen. Although, Team Deathmatch takes a different approach and encourages aggressive playstyles, as well as Firestorm (Battle Royale) which unfortunately is dead and almost impossible to find a lobby in. You're likely to wait 20 minutes to find a solo game and the lobby still wouldn't be full. That's a shame cause Firestorm is really fun. The campaign is probably one of the best I've ever played and it's immersion could mark my words. Instead of playing mission after mission as most campaigns force you to, in BF5, the missions are an open world battleground in which you decide in what order you should get your tasks done. The storyline itself also is one of the best out there. Last but not least, there are no pay to win bundles. I was surprised to see that an EA game isn't based on microtransactions. The game is fun and worth buying even in 2023.",5.2,0,1

"What makes this beautiful game bad is that there are so many cheaters. Literally, players with such low grades are aiming and shooting you in the head from such a big distance and there is no possible chance that they know where you are positioned on the map, shooting through walls and houses. Imagine you spent so much money on such a game and BF support let this happen. Almost the whole team reports a player, and he still is in the game rolling around. Kind of a waste of money, not for the game, but for the support that doesn't do anything. Maybe it's not even about support, but about developing an anti cheat system for this game. Please compare your anti-cheat system ($50 game) to the anti-cheat system of a game abbreviated with ""ROE"" (not full title to avoid advertising) which is free and then you will understand why BF is such a bad game. The ROE anti-cheat system bans your entire system, and cheaters still haven't figured out a way to crack it. But maybe you like to ban cheaters so they can buy your game again, maybe that's the reason, money always. 5/10 from me.",9.7,0,0

You can fight on huge maps, including destructible surrounding objects, which gives the game the feeling of a real war.

A huge selection of weapons and equipment also adds variety to the game. You can choose between different classes, each with unique skills and capabilities. Various types of weapons are available, from rifles and pistols to tanks and aeroplanes. The availability of different modes of transport allows players to choose the appropriate tactics and strategy in battle. The multiplayer component in Battlefield 5 also leaves a pleasant impression. It offers various modes and maps where players can fight with other players around the world. The progression system and various achievements give the game durability and increase motivation to continue the game. However, some players may find some issues in the gameplay balance. Some weapons and classes may seem too strong or weak in comparison with others, which may cause some dissatisfaction among experienced players. Also, some players note some technical problems and errors in the game, although the developers are actively working to fix these problems. In general, Battlefield 5 is an exciting and serious game that allows you to plunge into the atmosphere of war and fight epic battles.

"I bought the game despite the reviews saying the game is filled with cheaters because of the few people saying community servers are clean and moderated. It turns out, out of all the community servers there are only a few which have a suitable enough ping to play on, and even fewer are actually moderated. I would say half (feels like more than half though) of community servers that I've tried are allowing cheaters. As for the cheating, I've seen plenty of people speed hacking. I think thats the more common (and obvious to spot) cheat. I found 2 players in a match which were suspiciously consistent and fast at hitting shots. One of them was using a sniper and was headshotting people instantly. The other was using a machine gun and was also killing me before I had the chance to even spot him after peeking out of cover. Both of them had an irregularly high score compared to most other players. Both of them were also hitting me behind walls/through terrain every once in a while. I bought the game on sale for 12 bucks, and I would say its not worth any more than that in its current state. Absolutely do not recommend spending full price on this. Its a fun game but its been ruined by cheaters and by EA/Dice unwilling to moderate it in any meaningful way.",94.4,1,0

Salt: to enhance flavor Oil: Vegetable or canola oil, or melted butter could be substituted Flour: Bread Flour or All-Purpose Flour can both be used with no changes to the recipe. The exact amount of flour used will vary depending on different factors (altitude/humidity etc.). What matters is the texture of the dough.

"I think it's a given that future entries of games and movies should be generally better than their previous installments. Battlefield V, in many aspects, is far-and-away an improvement over it's predecessor, Battlefield 1. Movement, gun-play, and the overall game-play loop sees greatly appreciated changes and updates, that give players more freedom and options in the Battlefield sandbox. Additions like crouch-running offers flexibility in a player's tactical toolkit, and the Fortifications system allow individual squads and players to better contribute to the entire team's success, and provides more ability and incentive to defend objectives. The Reinforcements system further promotes team-play and cohesiveness within squads, by giving squad leaders strong rewards for setting and completing orders, and allowing them to turn the tide of an engagement. There are an innumerable other changes I could mention; in essence, Battlefield V is utterly, an unequivocal technical and game-play improvement over Battlefield 1. For that reason I recommend BFV to people to have played and enjoyed Battlefield 1; though for all the improvements of BFV, in it's current state it is somewhat buggy, and has a serious issue with blatant cheaters in many servers.",143.1,0,1

This is a fun game about half of the time if you get a full lobby on a good map. Some maps you will lose 9/10 times if you're one the wrong side simply because the enemy team can field more armor than you can. Tanks in this game are busted where they are near impossible to take out as infantry unless you have multiple guys shooting them with bazookas because your sticky bombs are useless since tanks can sit in third person and will see you coming from 20 meters away. By far the biggest issue though is the number of cheaters. Out of every 10 games you will run into cheaters at least twice. The worst part is these guys are blatant and it takes days for them to get banned. They will get mass reported for aimbotting you 200 meters away in a tank turret or speed hacking straight to you and killing you 10 seconds after spawning and then will follow you into the next game for about 2 hours. Buy at your own risk.,37.9,0,0
"The story campaign feels like rushed expansion pack DLC. I'm shocked that such a well known developer would ever release something this devoid of effort. -The maps are small and stories short. -Characters get hung up on invisible objects and run in place. -Your shots frequently don't register. -Any enemy that mounts a turret becomes impervious to gunfire from the front. Even when you shoot them in their fully exposed heads. -With some of the machine guns you can hip fire a full 30 round clip at an enemy 6 feet in front of you and not hit them once. Honestly, I've seen lone developers kitbash better and more polished games",6.0,0,0
"I would not recommend this game to anyone for anything but the solo story mode. The multiplayer is 90% cheaters, as EA Games doesn't have an effective cheat-prevention module. Channels on YouTube highlight cheaters who can show all enemies on their screen, alter the movement/speed of their own character to supernatural levels, shoot through walls and buildings, and even kick people off the servers to reduce the opposing team to half or quarter capacity, thus ensuring their win. I've recorded some ""spectator"" mode footage myself, and noted that players flying planes were bots: they had 0 bombs on their planes, and yet still were able to drop 8 - 12 bombs per pass. I've also recorded gameplay of the cheaters' health being replenished from 10% back to full 100% in 3 seconds, unlimited ammunition, and some type of script they run on their server connection that enhances the lethality of shots to the point that they don't even need to be firing close to you in order to kill you. Additionally, on their mini map, the cheaters have MW3-style full UAV mode, seeing where you are at all times on the map. softlocked lmao A Screenshot of Battlefield™ V By: Ultra This is really unfortunate, that a wonderfully-made game has such a short shelf-life. This game answers my prayers for a war game with great aesthetics & interplay; is not suffocated by activity and ""paranormal"" attributes given to soldiers, such as the COD/Modern Warfare dynasty -- except for one thing: the ""teleportation"" element of Snipers' radios allowing any players to enter at that point. I'm so over the ""supernatural"" realm entering into otherwise ""realistic"" games. Battlefield has a very clever & realistic attention to sound (utilizing echo and reverb), realistic object spacing & realistic timing, but the movement -- the distance a character can cover at running speed -- is a little stretched. The story lines that are intriguing. I played the solo missions in Norway as my first experience; the lush environment and character freewill was hypnotizing. A shame this game has gone in the trash.",198.4,0,0

The animation team truly did an amazing job. It's a shame some of this quality got lost in the 2042 / Portal installment. I have had many fun moments both reading the chat and playing with my friends. This game was harshly judged due to it's customization freedom. But I have to say, if you can overlook that, play the game. This game's never meant to be a ww2 sim or something of the likes.

Saw that the game was 80% off decided why the heck not lets get this game and try it out. What that? Cheaters are in the game? I'm sure that just a rare occurrence. Nope its not a rare occurrence.

"I played this game for about 400 hours on Origin and 34 hours on Steam, The game is great actually. I really like how it is made and it is working fine. There are some hackers now and then but you can just leave and play on another day. But what is even worse than hackers and cheaters is EA enforcing an update of the menu UI each time they want to promote another game. This time it is a new Battlefield 2042 season. Bro WTF, do you really think I want to play your crappy new games? Same ♥♥♥♥ for BFBC2... I still play the old games. Old is gold! But your new ♥♥♥♥ is does not even work. Even Farming simulator 2022 has more players. Please stop promoting ♥♥♥♥ to your loyal playerbase or you will loose them as well.",34.6,9,0

Add this on to the fact they have no anti cheat system after all this time, it's rare to have a round without cheaters. It is a critical failure on EA's part, they're probably trying to force people to play their new game by making this one unplayable or un-enjoyable. EA and dice are trash and will never get one more cent from me. I don't care if they make the greatest game in history they can stick it up their ass.",738.4,1,0
"Game looks amazing, no doubt, the things this engine can do are a feat. The Campaigns are too short, do not learn history from this game. If it showed the truth, then all Allies had to do during WW2 was to get 10 norwegian girls and war would be over in a week, they would kill all the nazis. Origin or EA play or whatever it is called now is the worst thing. 4 times out of 5 the game thinks EA play is not running and it starts lagging like 10 second freeze, 3 second smooth 60 FPS, then again 10 second freeze. Sometimes it will happen during game as well, not only when starting it. Absolute garbage.",6.5,0,0
"EA has completely abandoned this game. It is overrun with hackers. They don't even have to be a player in the game. Text chat is useless because it is non-stop spam by a bot. If there isn't a cheater in the game, just play for 30 minutes or less- one will soon join and disrupt the game so badly that players will leave the server in droves. It would take EA literally just a few seconds to perma-ban these accounts, but they refuse. All my attempts to draw attention to issues fall on deaf ears. Because it is so rampant and started almost immediately after the launch of 2042, my only conclusion is that EA is allowing or actively trying to destroy this game to drive people to buy the new game. As such, I will never, ever, EVER purchase an EA game again. Because as soon as something new comes out, EA has demonstrated the problems with still very-good-games skyrocket to unplayable heights.",210.8,4,0

"IMPORTANT UPDATE: Since creating this review most european ROBOT Servers have been removed since it was found out that virtually everybody hosting a ROBOT Server cheated themselves. So yeah, welcome to BFV --- End Update Normal matchmaking doesn't work on public servers thanks to cheaters en mass, so the first recommendation you will get, if you google this problem, is to go to community servers => search for servers with [ROBOT] in their name. However, most of those don't really use anti cheat protection, you will commonly find people will 100 kills to 4 deaths or something of the sort. The server where you have that protection are still a solid gaming experience, however, according to the data they show you can still expect at least 1% of players to be cheaters - Just are reminder, those 1% of people playing are found out cheaters on community servers with extra protection, so you can imagine the amount of unreported or not found cases. And way, way more on the official server without any protection at all. Since community servers are run by private persons, you can be banned for no reason at all at any time from that server. And some of them have, weirdly enough, strong ""Anti-China talk not allowed"" rules. I'm still having fun, 2 of 3 games are a solid experience, no trouble finding games as of 10/23, but if a friend came to me and ask if he should buy BFV, it would be a no.",58.4,0,0

"the overall gameplay and multiplayer are pretty fun. i like how sniping feels in this game. thats about all the good i have to say about this game at the moment. admited the game is basically dead at this point and has been for a while. im not a fan of the last few games that i litterally just had. finally got some games where someone wasnt blatantly cheating, and yet i spent a good 20min of that game spawning and either instantly dying because of spawn campers either in tanks or dive bombing in planes. to even just a random dude camped right next to a spawn point so they can shotgun you instantly. dont get me wrong i get it its a game. but ive been on both sides of that, and it isnt fun spending most of the 30 minute game doing nothing either because you keep dying or because you cant ♥♥♥♥♥♥ find anyone. thats if you get a game without a cheater. if you do there is no question about it. ive had a few games where my bullets litteraly would hit someone they ♥♥♥♥ thier head back you get the blood animation and them continue to shoot at you. this is while im using a sniper. but didnt get a hit marker. either that or the lag gets to it and goes right through. but this is a base game issue that has to do more with how it handles lag. with 64 players in a lobby sometimes things happen and whatever no big deal. but when its like that the entire game it feels like youve been given a nerf gun in a gun fight against 8 people with real 240 bravos. when you get a cheater it makes that worse. everything from instant respawn. (they get ragdolled by a tank, then after thier body lands thier up again and still shooting. saw someone do this 6 times in a row) to people basically just having god mode/speed hacks, infinate ammo spamming snipers at 500rpm like an lmg its dumb. all that and there is an increasing likelyhood that you log on and thier is no games active. (nobody else in the world is playing) ive logged in to find this a few times lately. at one point the servers were dedicated based on region alone. now if your country shares a native language with another they lump those sometimes as much as 4 regions togeather and thats the coomon servers for that area. that and private games really are all ive seen active. you may get lucky durring the weekend and get to play a few actually decent games. but aside from that the game isnt worth it. its been long abandoned by ea, to include banning cheaters. i spent 7 dollars on this game and honestly it was fun while it lasted but it frustrates me how good this game could have still been let alone could be, if only ea stepped in and actually did thier part. i wouldnt spend 30-60 on this game in the current state its in. especially considering its not likely to change",396.3,0,0

"Battlefield V is like the ultimate spicy adventure, and speaking of spice, here's a recipe for a hot sauce that'll leave you sweating bullets : **Ingredients:** - 10-12 spicy chili peppers (choose your heat level) - 3 cloves of garlic - 1 small onion - 1 cup distilled white vinegar - 1 teaspoon salt - 1 teaspoon sugar - A pinch of gunpowder (just kidding!) **Instructions:** 1. Roast the chili peppers, garlic, and onion in a hot skillet until they're slightly charred and aromatic. This step adds some smoky flavor to your sauce, just like the fiery explosions in Battlefield V. 2. Remove the stems from the peppers and roughly chop the roasted ingredients. 3. In a blender, combine the roasted peppers, garlic, and onion with vinegar, salt, and sugar. Blitz it until you have a smooth, fiery concoction that's hotter than a tank battle in the game. 4. Transfer your homemade hot sauce to a bottle and let it cool down, just like you cool down after an intense round of Battlefield V. Now, with your homemade hot sauce in hand, you're ready for some scorching action in Battlefield V. It's the perfect way to add some heat to your gaming sessions, both on the screen and on your plate! 🔥🎮",1.9,0,1

There is a lot of good things about it, in terms of mechanics and ability to enjoy WW2 tanks, planes and armoured vehicles. But it is beyond broken. I have played my final game, in a map where the enemy team were able to constantly call artillery strikes. This is a new hack, in addition to the known hacks, eg wall hack, aim bot, and there are mods to disable smoke or foliage etc. There has been many problems with the hacks in this game and it has been known for a long time. New hacks are coming out where you can make the whole enemy team respawn instantly. That means any plane that was used crashes, and any tank the team had blows up/is taken by the other team. There is no chance against cheats and it is the fault of EA Dice. It is an absolute s*it show and everyone who has ever brought it should get their money back AND compensation for time wasted.

"Verdict: B Tier, 7/10, 3.5 stars, Worth a Buy? No, if you're solely interested in playing singleplayer or you value historical accuracy. Yes, if you prefer multiplayer because there are still a lot of players playing it, but be aware that you will run into cheaters and that is why I don't recommend it. Additionally, the price is excessive, thereby purchasing during a sale is recommended. The Good: - Missions can be replayed. - War stories can be played at any order. - Skippable cutscenes. - An Axis focused war story. - War stories are in their native languages. - HUD can be customised. - The audio is outstanding and realistic. - The soundtrack is excellent. - Good destruction and levolution. - Graphics and visuals are great - Tutorial sandbox map. - Gunplay feels good. - Good stable performance. - Fun multiplayer. - Improved movement such as leaning and crouch sprinting. - EA app launcher is required. - You can't pause cutscenes - Many unneeded stealth sections. - The campaign's stealth mechanics don't actually function well. - Historical revisionism. - Censorship of historical symbols and the chat filter. - The campaign AI is very buggy and awful. - Campaign can be buggy. - The campaign has very bad writing and gameplay design. - Cosmetic microtransactions. - High Price tag. - 90GB install size. - Anti-Cheat is useless. - Many Cheaters. - Some gamemodes are inactive. - Community servers have less features. - Loading times can sometimes feel a bit too long. - Very CPU intensive. - Multiplayer is prioritised above single-player. - A 100% achievement completion rate requires completion of multiplayer achievements. - Some of the changes to the standard battlefield gameplay could be considered good or bad. - Historical accuracy is god awful. - Arcade shooter with a little bit of realism. - Maps can be big or small. - Accessibility options for colourblind users. - Multiple protagonists. - Multiple campaigns. - 5–7 hour campaign. - There's hardly much blood or gore. - Player customisation. - All weapon and equipment are unlocked. - CO-OP missions. - Doesn't really feel like a WW2 game. - Didn't experience any crashes or freezing. - Stable performance at the highest settings. - Very CPU intensive. - Softlocked twice when using binoculars, unable to change weapons or complete any campaign objectives. During the Norway War Story, I had to restart to a checkpoint twice because the game softlocked and I couldn't continue the story. One of these was brought on the mother getting stuck on a desk. - 4/5 rating. This was a significant step up in difficulty from earlier games when played in hardcore mode. At times, especially during the unplayable stealth sections which conclude in a gun and spray, it can feel unfair. You'll spend a lot of time prone after getting shot, waiting for your health to replenish. I also tried the hard setting, and it felt about the same as previous game's hard setting. Ammo is once again plentiful, and health recovery is still quick. It's horrible, really bad. In war stories, it also includes some offensive historical revisionism. No consideration is given to the distribution of weapons because occasionally you may find late-war weapons in an early-war situation. Censorship of historical emblems and flags undermines immersion and logic. Includes non-historical female soldiers in multiplayer. Same stealth in Battlefield 1, basically. They didn't even make it better. In a battlefield game, stealth portions are completely unnecessary, but level designers adore them. The AI detection is flawed because I frequently saw instances of them finding me, such as on hardcore when they were able to see me through walls and such. Additionally, you can engage in a shootout with AI, and enemies who are merely nearby won't even react. It was a horrendously awful experience that felt unnecessary. contains a lot of stealth sections as well. Only ""The Last Tiger"" is the story. I advise you to play considering it was good. I'll now give a brief overview of my campaign experience. A rather boring story: 1 man army situations; The dialogue is poor and artificial; The other two SBS members vanish and are not present; Using homemade explosives; A random plane appears and knows where you are; When you are unarmed, a German driving a jeep approaches you and points an mp40 at you; When the screen goes black, the German is in the trunk; Because an evacuation point was never planned for, you must rely on a German radio to request one. German in the trunk remains uninjured despite the vehicle being shot through multiple times; Despite not knowing where you are, a rescue team manages to save you at the ideal time. Revisionist history the mission, such an offensive retelling of the actual operation; Had two softlocks as well; Skiing was enjoyable; 1 women army moments; The majority of the mission is stealth, and you can shoot searchlights but not regular lights; An 18-year-old girl can outmatch males of military age; Instead of shooting you, a German suddenly spawns and charges towards you; Mother teleports over to the bridge; You avoided harm despite being flung from a bridge and falling down a mountain; You plunge down a cliff into a lake in subfreezing weather; You live, and there is no damage to the documents; In a lake, a submarine; Stupid bunker ambush; In a shootout near the submarine, two Germans sneak up on you. Mother flees with a grenade, and the guy shoots her in the stomach rather than killing her. He then doesn't finish her off, and she then blows up the submarine. A missed opportunity of a good story due to historical revisionism and inaccurate portrayals of the Tirailleur; Although there are big battles in the story stealth is still present; In one scene, you and your companions are defeated and killed, and you are knocked out. When you finally awaken, everything is fine. The best story, though, suffers from being too short. Wish the campaign was run this way the entire time. The writing was decent but again suffers from being too short. Unfortunately, this mission contains a lot of censored imagery, notably the German flag. With little to no stealth, the mission is primarily carried out in a Tiger tank. Although it seems implausible that a single tank can easily wipe out a whole army. Even so, it was enjoyable. Also, the level destruction was excellent because to your use of the tank's weapon. The only good war story.",15.6,25,0

on every battle field there should be a mode where you angrily have to dump full clips into people for noobs and hardcore mode for us dedicated players. there should be no hud or bullet count jsut zero distance no crosshair. you reload with bullets in your clip still you loose those bullets soldiers dont carry dead weight ammunition. also let us spray paint our ♥♥♥♥♥♥ guys camo on personally after a certain level is accomplished....i wanna be a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ leaf with a rifle in the distance. sniper classes should be able to paint the gilly suits anything else is foobar. also allow for knife kills with the option to press button after and catch their fall set them down quietly.and a sneak mode when crouched by clicking to activate crouch then clicking again and holding activates sneakier quieter footsteps. fbe a new thing where when you are hit with ricochets nearby or gernades nearby you loose your ability to hear alittle more more echoes and warped noise. warfar is rediculously loud and most these characters would be deaf in one ear or both. also when sniping vast distances more heat of the ground. also when piloting rediculous gs there should be black outs that you can grow tolerance too more and more. Also please ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sponsor me ....this is the only game i play and working for you is my onlh chance to get a job pretty much thats on you now though i did all i can do on the sidelines here ....if you hire me or sponsor me ill give you 3 easy killhits your not thinking of and i know one will take off like call of duty zombies did in the beginning and still does..its mad simple too wouldnt take probably a month or two. and can be added on too battlefield as extra thing like gernade dodgeball for half life or counter strike also please bring that back as well,1358.2,0,1

I have played Battlefield since it's original release BF-1942 and have been a loyal fan ever since. I am a die-hard. I truly miss the original style of game play of the 1942 series and the cool patches that you could download. My favorite patch was the original Vietnam patch.. The one before the official game came out. Those were the best. I keep playing in the hope of some of those originals coming back out in some way shape or form. But this game suffices and satisfies me for now.,131.0,0,1

"Battlefield V is a visually stunning and action-packed addition to the iconic Battlefield series. DICE has once again managed to deliver an immersive World War II experience that takes gamers on a thrilling journey through some of the most iconic battles in history. The graphics in Battlefield V are nothing short of spectacular. The attention to detail in the game's environments, weapons, and character models is awe-inspiring. Every battlefield feels alive and filled with an impressive level of destruction, adding to the realism of the game. The Frostbite engine truly shines in this iteration. The gameplay in Battlefield V maintains the series' signature large-scale battles and destructible environments. Whether you're assaulting a fortified enemy position or defending it, the game offers a variety of maps and modes that cater to different playstyles. The addition of Grand Operations is a highlight, providing epic multi-day battles with unique objectives. One of the major changes in Battlefield V is the removal of the traditional class system, replaced by the more flexible ""Combat Roles."" While this change might not sit well with everyone, it adds a layer of adaptability to the gameplay, allowing players to customize their loadout and role more freely. The sound design in Battlefield V is extraordinary. The roar of tanks, the ping of bullets, and the screams of soldiers all contribute to an immersive experience. It's clear that DICE has spared no effort in making the auditory elements as authentic as possible. However, it's worth noting that Battlefield V had its share of issues, particularly at launch, such as balance problems and missing content. But DICE actively listened to the community and provided numerous updates and patches to address these concerns. As a result, the game has evolved and improved significantly since its release. The single-player War Stories are engaging, providing a fresh perspective on World War II through various short campaigns. They may not be as memorable as some other single-player titles, but they offer a nice change of pace from the multiplayer action. In summary, Battlefield V is an outstanding addition to the Battlefield series, offering breathtaking visuals, intense gameplay, and a compelling take on World War II. It's a must-play for fans of the franchise and anyone looking for an immersive and action-packed multiplayer shooter. Despite its rocky start, DICE's ongoing support and improvements have made it a worthy contender in the genre. With the addition of the Pacific Theater and other content updates, Battlefield V has only become more captivating over time. Whether you're a seasoned veteran or a newcomer to the series, this game is well worth your time and attention.",29.1,0,1

"Title: Where History and Intensity Collide - My Review of ""Battlefield V"" ""Battlefield V"", the second latest installment in the iconic Battlefield franchise, is a symphony of chaos and camaraderie that thrusts players into the tumultuous battlegrounds of World War II. Developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts, this game stands as a testament to the series' dedication to delivering heart-pounding action, strategic depth, and an immersive historical experience. From the moment you dive into the action, ""Battlefield V"" sweeps you off your feet with its stunning visuals and attention to detail. The environments are nothing short of breathtaking, capturing the diverse landscapes of WWII conflict zones in all their gritty glory. Whether you're dodging through the ruins of Rotterdam or sniping from the dense Norwegian forests, each location feels like a painstakingly crafted work of art. But beyond the visual splendor lies a game-play experience that is as exhilarating as it is challenging. ""Battlefield V"" boasts a refined combat system that strikes a balance between accessibility and realism. The gun-play is crisp and satisfying, demanding both precision and adaptability. Every weapon feels unique, influencing your play-style and encouraging experimentation as you navigate through an arsenal of historically accurate firearms. What truly sets ""Battlefield V"" apart is its commitment to teamwork. The game rewards cooperation and coordination in ways that few other titles achieve. Whether you're in a squad pushing towards an objective, calling out enemy positions, or providing vital support as a medic or engineer, the sense of interdependence is palpable. The ""Squad Reinforcements"" system adds another layer to this camaraderie, enabling squads to summon powerful assets like V-1 rockets or supply drops for a strategic edge. Grand Operations, a hallmark of ""Battlefield V"", encapsulates the game's essence flawlessly. This multi-day mode strings together a series of connected battles, incorporating dynamic weather changes and resource management, all while narrating a gripping historical context. Each encounter feels consequential, making victory taste sweet and defeat genuinely disheartening. This mode stands as a pinnacle of game design, offering an epic narrative that unfolds through player actions. The journey through ""Battlefield V's"" World War II is enriched by its single-player War Stories. While not exhaustive in number, these vignettes deliver emotional and thought-provoking tales that shed light on lesser-known aspects of the war. They immerse you in diverse perspectives, from the Norwegian resistance to a French colonial soldier's struggle for recognition. These stories remind us that the war was not a singular experience but a tapestry of stories waiting to be told. However, Battlefield V is not without its minor battle scars. Some fans might miss the iconic narratives of previous Battlefield titles, and the initial content launch was lean compared to expectations. But DICE's commitment to regular updates and the introduction of the Tides of War system, providing a steady stream of new content, gradually assuaged these concerns. Overall, ""Battlefield V"" is a triumph that melds historical authenticity with heart-pounding game-play. It captures the essence of World War II while delivering a modern gaming experience that rewards teamwork, strategy, and individual skill. Its breathtaking visuals, intense combat, and emphasis on camaraderie cement it as a worthy addition to the Battlefield legacy. Whether you're storming the beaches of Normandy, engaging in dogfights over the skies of Rotterdam, or battling in the shadow of a V-1 rocket, ""Battlefield V"" ensures that history's untold stories resonate through the chaos of war.",343.4,9,1

"New York Cheesecake Ingredients For the crust 85g butter, plus extra for tin 140g digestive biscuits, made into fine crumbs (add 2 extra biscuits if you like a thicker base) 1 tbsp sugar, granulated or golden caster For the cheesecake filling 900g Philadelphia cheese, or other full-fat soft cheese 250g golden caster sugar 3 tbsp plain flour 1 ½ tsp vanilla extract finely grated zest of 1 lemon (about 2 tsp) 1 ½ tsp lemon juice 3 large eggs, plus 1 yolk 284ml carton soured cream For the soured cream topping 142ml carton soured cream 1 tbsp golden caster sugar 2 tsp lemon juice Method STEP 1 Position an oven shelf in the middle of the oven. Heat the oven to 180C/ 160C fan/ gas 4. STEP 2 Line the base of a 23cm springform cake tin by putting a square piece of parchment paper or foil on top of the tin base and then clipping the side on so the paper or foil is trapped and any excess sticks out of the bottom. STEP 3 For the crust, melt 85g butter in a medium pan. Stir in 140g digestive biscuit crumbs and 1 tbsp golden caster or granulated sugar so the mixture is evenly moistened. STEP 4 Press the mixture into the bottom of the pan and bake for 10 minutes. Cool on a wire rack while preparing the filling. STEP 5 For the filling, increase the oven temperature to fan 220C/ 200C fan/ gas 7. In a table top mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, beat 900g full-fat soft cheese at medium-low speed until creamy, about 2 minutes. STEP 6 With the mixer on low, gradually add 250g golden caster sugar, then 3 tbsp plain flour and a pinch of salt, scraping down the sides of the bowl and the paddle twice. STEP 7 Swap the paddle attachment for the whisk. Continue by adding 1½ tsp vanilla extract, 2 tsp lemon zest and 1½ tsp lemon juice. Whisk in 3 large eggs and 1 yolk, one at a time, scraping the bowl and whisk at least twice. STEP 8 Stir a 284ml carton of soured cream until smooth, then measure 200ml (just over ¾ of the carton). Continue on low speed as you add the measured soured cream (reserve the rest). Whisk to blend, but don't over-beat. The batter should be smooth, light and somewhat airy. STEP 9 Brush the sides of the springform tin with melted butter and put on a baking sheet. Pour in the filling - if there are any lumps, sink them using a knife - the top should be as smooth as possible. Bake for 10 minutes. STEP 10 Reduce oven temperature to 110C/ 90C fan/ gas ¼ and bake for 45 minutes more. If you gently shake the tin, the filling should have a slight wobble. STEP 11 Turn off the oven and open the oven door for a cheesecake that's creamy in the centre, or leave it closed if you prefer a drier texture. Let cool in the oven for 2 hours. The cheesecake may get a slight crack on top as it cools. STEP 12 Combine the reserved soured cream with a 142ml carton soured cream, 1 tbsp golden caster sugar and 2 tsp lemon juice for the topping. Spread over the cheesecake right to the edges. Cover loosely with foil and refrigerate for at least 8 hours or overnight. STEP 13 Run a round-bladed knife around the sides of the tin to loosen any stuck edges. Unlock the side, slide the cheesecake off the bottom of the tin onto a plate, then slide the parchment paper out from underneath. RECIPE TIPS MIXING THE INGREDIENTS The way you blend the ingredients is crucial: under-beating can lead to a lumpy mixture, over-beating can whip in too much air. This can result in uneven cooking, bubbles, and cracking. KEEP EVERYTHING AT ROOM TEMPERATURE Keep everything at room temperature. To avoid lumps and ensure even mixing without over-beating, it is essential to have the soft cheese at room temperature before starting. Ideally, let it come to room temperature in its pack for 2 hours. If you're short of time, cut the soft cheese into chunks and leave to soften for 1 hour. It also helps to have a tabletop mixer with a powerful motor. But if you don't have one, a hand-held mixer works fine.",52.8,0,1

"I don't understand why there are still so many modders, hackers and cheaters in this game for each multiplayer sessions. I thought anti cheat system should have work well here.

Quite disappointed with this. I bought this game to play fair. But, cheaters way too much in multiplayer online sessions. If anyone still want to purchase this game, well trust me. Don't buy.

"Battlefield 5 opens with a solemn prologue in which you play as a series of doomed soldiers dying in increasingly horrible ways. Its intent, I presume, is to evoke the futility and horror of war. But it feels out of place in a game where you can wear a Union Jack gas mask, jump out of a plane in mid-air, land on your feet, then whack a Nazi over the head with a cricket bat. Developer DICE can’t seem to decide if war is hell, or just cool as hell, which creates some wild tonal dissonance. The notoriously chaotic Battlefield is by no means an accurate approximation of a real, gruelling war, which makes a soldier’s agonised screams of “I wanna go home!” as he bleeds out just seem a bit tasteless. The Swedish studio needs to own the fact that its game is really just a fun, silly, knockabout shooter, because that what it does best. In the thick of a firefight, with planes screaming overhead, tanks trundling by, and sniper scopes glinting in the distance, Battlefield 5 can be exhilarating. And the dense, detailed maps only add to the turmoil, particularly the post-apocalyptic Devastation, which is set among the shattered ruins of a bombed-out Rotterdam. With 64 players fighting together, few multiplayer games are this frenzied. And a welcome return to World War II brings back fond memories of the first wave of Battlefield games. This chaos also results in some exciting, emergent moments that could almost be scripted set pieces, such as the Spitfire I saw flying too low and buzzing a church’s bell tower, carving a hole in the side with its wing and leaving a trail of dust and rubble. But this can also work against it, and I’ve lost count of the visual bugs I’ve encountered: usually involving corpses getting stuck in scenery or flailing around like they’re being reanimated by a necromancer. Ultimately, there are no bad maps in Battlefield 5: just a few mediocre ones This is a series famous for its destruction, but now you can build things too. Whip out your hammer and on certain parts of the map—usually around control points—you’ll see the shimmering outline of sandbags, barbed wire, and other buildable fortifications. Any class can build them and you don’t have to harvest resources or anything like that, but the process is slow and leaves you open to attack while you wait for a meter to slowly tick up. A good example of this is in the Aerodrome map, where the entrance to a large aircraft hangar can be plugged up with cover, Czech hedgehogs, and other obstacles to make the lives of the opposing team more difficult. Some maps even let you dig trenches for your fellow troops to move safely through. It never feels like the outcome of a battle hangs on the construction of these fortifications, but they can really change the flow of a map. Speaking of maps, it’s a mixed bag, but some are among Battlefield’s best. Twisted Steel is the clear highlight: a vast, swampy map set in France and dominated by an enormous bridge, part of which has dramatically collapsed. Below the structure is a marshy forest for skirmishing in, but it’s on the bridge itself where the most exciting firefights inevitably take place around the two capture points placed strategically at either end of it. PERFORMANCE & SETTINGS Graphics options Field of view, motion blur, chromatic aberration, film grain, HDR, future frame rendering, texture quality, texture filtering, lighting quality, anti-aliasing post-processing, effects quality, post-process quality Performance Predictably, Battlefield 5 runs beautifully on a PC with an RTX 2080 Ti I tested it on. But on my GTX 1080 at home I had to knock the graphics preset down to high to keep a mostly stable 60fps at 1440p. I also experienced some judder, particularly on the Narvik map. DXR is another story, and you can check out our Battlefield 5 performance analysis for the details. When the enemy team has control of the bridge, wrestling it back from them is a fun, satisfying challenge. Its elevated position gives snipers a great vantage point on the swamp and buildings below, but luckily the bridge is strewn with rubble and flaming wrecks, providing just enough cover for the opposing team to push through and claw back territory. Arras is another great map: an expanse of French countryside covered in vivid yellow rapeseed fields. The open areas are perfect for vehicle skirmishes, while infantry can battle for control of the farmhouses and villages scattered around the area. Fjell 652, set in the mountains of Norway, is a lot of fun too, particularly the control point situated among a scattering of cabins. Its exposed mountainside location makes for some hectic firefights, with opportunities for distant snipers and aircraft to make your life hell. Less successful is Devastation, the Rotterdam-based map I mentioned earlier. It’s visually impressive and incredibly atmospheric, but the cluttered geometry and lack of clear, identifiable paths to each control point make it feel messy and poorly paced. Hamada, a large desert map, is great for vehicle combat, but the distances between control points and the generally increased time-to-kill in Battlefield 5 mean you spend a lot of time running back to where you died and, if you’re unlucky, being sniped by someone on the way. Narvik and Aerodrome sit somewhere in the middle. The former is based around a Norwegian harbour town, and except for a few memorably tense fights around an elevated train yard on the waterfront, nothing really sticks out about it. The latter is another big, open map ideally suited to vehicles and I only really found it interesting when both armies descended on the colossal hangar at the heart of the map. Ultimately, there are no bad maps in Battlefield 5: just a few mediocre ones. And for an online-focused FPS at launch, that’s pretty decent. Squads are more important than ever in Battlefield 5. Not only can you spawn on an ally if they aren’t engaged in combat, but now non-medic characters can perform a ‘buddy revive’ on a fallen comrade. This is a lot slower than when a medic does it, but still fairly invaluable in the final stages of a match. It also encourages squads to stay close together, as tempting as it might be to run off and test out your new sniper rifle. You can still leave your assigned squad and play as a lone wolf, but the game actively discourages it. Another benefit of working in a team is that, when enough points are accumulated, the leader can call in a so-called Squad Reinforcement. These range from a fire-spewing tank to, best of all, a devastating rocket that can absolutely flatten a control point, killing anyone in the blast radius. The sound of the aircraft that launches it buzzing overhead is always nerve-wracking—unless you’re the one firing it, of course. You can see the explosion from way across the map, and pushing in with your fellow soldiers to take a point after a rocket drops on it is always a thrilling moment. Building on Battlefield 1’s Operations mode, Grand Operations are vast, themed battles that take place over three days, loosely connected with a story that changes depending on the performance of each team. While Battlefield is often a good game to dip in and out of, you’ll need to set a decent chunk of time aside—in some matches, as long as an hour—for these sprawling epics. Each day is heavily objective-based, with teams attacking or defending key structures including giant artillery guns that players can operate. I’m not sure about Final Stand, though. This tie-breaker round is triggered if both teams are evenly matched and there’s no clear winner. Essentially playing out like the tense final minutes of a game of Fortnite or PUBG, respawns are disabled and surviving players are gradually pushed together by a shrinking play space. The last team standing wins the Grand Operation, which kinda negates your team’s performance in the previous rounds. While Call of Duty has abandoned singleplayer, it’s good to see DICE still",26.1,0,1

"Battlefield V was on sale for like 10 bucks so I bought it without hesitation. I've been absent from the battlefield series since 2011 so here's a fresh look at Battlefield V: Campaign: While the campaign offers fresh and otherwise unknown perspectives of WWII, the singleplayer experience lacks depth. It's basically 5 ""episodes"" with a different protagonist in each one taking place in various fronts of WWII. It feels more like a tutorial rather than an actual story mode and if I'm not mistaken, BF 1 also had the same format. It can be fun for a while but the cinematic cutscenes and the stealth playstyle the campaign promotes most of the time ruins the fun imo and makes it feel like a knock-off Far Cry. FAR different approach in comparison with older story driven BF titles! The multiplayer is actually very fun, which makes me believe that BF5 development was multiplayer-centered. Fun weapons,balanced progression, great character and weapon customization, classic BF mechanics. The only issue someone will definitely encounter are the hackers, 4 out of 5 games have hackers on both teams, using speedhacks, aimbot and ruining the experience don't play on DICE servers, play on community games and just like that *poof* hackers are gone.",31.8,0,1

"I picked this game up when it was on sale on steam for quite a considerable bargain. Graphics - 7/10 Gun Play - 8/10 Atmosphere - 7/10 Optimization - 9.5/10 This game is good if you're looking for a casual sandbox FPS that doesn't require you to sweat to have fun. The immersion is on point, the gun play is polished, the graphics are good, exactly the attributes you would want in an immersive FPS that you can actually enjoy. It doesn't quite have the atmosphere that Battlefield 1 does, as it's more, ""bright"" themed; lacking a gritty, war based atmosphere that makes battlefield, well, battlefield. Despite this unfortunate aspect, it still beats Battlefield 2042 in immersion and overall experience, which isn't really saying much, but at least its something. Movement feels a little clunky, especially when sliding and jumping, this provides a slower pace than most modern shooters. Due to Battlefields way of forcing clients to use anti-aliasing - which is an issue in numerous titles of the franchise - the graphics are a little more blurry on edges than i would prefer: this makes it hard to spot enemies in the distance. This game is very well optimized, especially if you compare it to Battlefield 2042. If you have an RTX GPU and would like to take advantage of DLSS, Battlefield V has the option, but they force you to turn on ray-tracing to use it, which is ludicrously stupid. Battlefield V has done a pretty decent job at fixing their bugs and glitches for the most part. I would say that the most annoying bug/glitch in Battlefield games are the rag doll physics after your character dies, feeling very unrealistic and sometimes glitching through the map, however Battlefield V is not the only entry in the franchise to fall victim to this specific issue. My biggest con with this game is that the player base is dying, and it is sometimes hard to find a populated server in which to play on, as most of the player base are finally transitioning to battlefield 2042 after updates to the game. Because of this issue, I wouldn't recommend purchasing the game at full price at all, instead, waiting for a considerable sale is the best, ""bang for your buck"".",127.8,0,1

"Despite having spent hundreds of hours playing this game, i still find it lacking in certain aspects, at least from my perspective. In a 20 vs 20 match, there are typically 3 or 4 players waiting for an airplane or tank. With no means to communicate effectively with teammates, this lack of coordination has diminished the strategic elements of the game. The outcome, whether victory or defeat, seems to rely on just 1 or 2 skilled players. For instance, newcomers might achieve 10 kills but suffer 30 or 40 deaths. On the other hand, experts can achieve 100 or 200 kills without dying even once.",275.1,0,0

Preheat oven to 425 degrees F (220 degrees C). 2. Combine butter, white sugar, brown sugar, water, cinnamon, and salt in a saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, remove from heat and set aside. 3. Roll out half the pastry to fit a 9-inch pie plate. Place bottom crust in pie plate; pour in apple slices. 4. Roll out top crust into a 10-inch circle. Cut into 8 (1-inch) wide strips with a sharp paring knife or pastry wheel. Weave the pastry strips, one at a time, into a lattice pattern. Fold the ends of the lattice strips under the edge of the bottom crust and crimp to seal. 5. Pour butter-sugar mixture over top of pie, coating the lattice, and allowing any remaining sauce to drizzle through the crust. 6. Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce heat to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C), and bake until the crust is golden brown, the caramel on the top crust is set, and the apple filling is bubbling, 35 to 40 more minutes.

Why I don't recommend this game despite enjoying it generally and no doubt continuing to play it after i leave this reviewL: - there are hacker galore; it's ridiculous and obvious and EA/DICE couldn't give a toss. - server reliability is completely unpredicatable. google battlefield packet loss and you'll see. great system, great connection, great ping, server full of similar people...screw your fun, have unpredicatable unplayable lag spikes for no reason. who needs packets anyway? game and fun ruining experience. when it works, and when they are no hackers, it's generally great. a few game breaking mechanics if you get unlucky (one person who is a weapon in a plane can control a whole map and be essentially impervious to destruction. a handful of CS1.6 refguees sniping can prevent anyone on either team aside from them achieving or enjoying anything on some maps.) spend your money elsewhere. play CounterStrike or Red Dead Redemption 2 or something like that. //edit// also the EA is by far the worst DRM out there. just doesn't work properly, ever. trash trash trash.",225.9,2,0

"Battlefield V - A Gritty and Immersive World War II Experience Rating: ★★★★☆ Battlefield V, released in 2018, brings players back to the tumultuous era of World War II, offering a visceral and immersive depiction of the conflict on both the grand scale and the personal level. With its detailed environments, strategic gameplay, and commitment to historical accuracy, the game delivers a captivating war experience that honors its roots while introducing new elements to the franchise. The game's graphical prowess is immediately evident, with stunningly detailed maps that capture the devastation and chaos of the war. From the snow-covered landscapes of Norway to the urban battlegrounds of Rotterdam, each location feels authentically designed and meticulously crafted, immersing players in the gritty atmosphere of the conflict. The single-player War Stories provide a series of poignant and diverse narratives that shed light on lesser-known aspects of World War II. These stories focus on individual soldiers and civilians, showcasing the personal sacrifices and challenges they faced during the war. While the narratives are engaging, some players may find them relatively short and yearn for more in-depth storytelling. Multiplayer remains the heart of Battlefield V, offering large-scale battles and strategic gameplay that the series is known for. The ""Attrition"" system, where players have limited ammo and health, encourages teamwork and careful resource management. This shift adds depth to the gameplay, fostering a greater reliance on squad cooperation and strategic decision-making. The ""Fortifications"" mechanic is a noteworthy addition, allowing players to construct defensive structures and fortify positions. This mechanic adds a layer of strategy and creativity to the gameplay, as players can adapt their surroundings to suit their playstyle and team objectives. The class-based system returns with tweaks, offering distinct roles that contribute to the team's success. The addition of the ""Grand Operations"" mode, spanning multiple days and matches, provides an epic and evolving battle experience that showcases the ebb and flow of a war campaign. Battlefield V's live service model ensures a consistent stream of content updates, introducing new maps, weapons, vehicles, and modes over time. This approach keeps the experience fresh and engaging, encouraging players to return for new challenges and experiences. The game's commitment to historical accuracy is commendable, aiming to depict the weaponry, vehicles, and uniforms of the era authentically. However, some players may still find occasional historical inaccuracies or creative liberties taken for gameplay balance. On the downside, the game faced criticism at launch for its initial lack of content and technical issues. While these concerns have been addressed through post-launch updates, they did impact the game's reputation during its early days. In conclusion, Battlefield V offers an immersive and authentic World War II experience that successfully captures the intensity and scale of the conflict. With its stunning visuals, strategic gameplay, and commitment to historical accuracy, the game stands as a strong entry in the Battlefield series that will appeal to fans of both the franchise and historical shooters. If you're a fan of realistic and tactical multiplayer shooters or have an interest in the historical events of World War II, Battlefield V is worth exploring as it provides a gripping and visceral depiction of the era's chaos and heroism.",20.6,0,1

"So it is finally time to give my 2 cents about this game. I played this game on 2 platforms: Xbox and PC. Battlefield 5 started already good: The feministic move to add females on the front line was unacceptable. But that's not even what bothers me anymore, I unfortunately learned to live with it. No, what really bothers me are the cheaters in this game, using cheat engines, to enhance their chance on survival, and capabilities. Each match you enter, there will be someone in the chat say there is a cheater, and yep, a couple of seconds, after jumping in the field, you indeed get this confirmed. This is awful, and it makes me mad. There is absolutely nothing what we can do about it either, since the report system is not connected to an active staff that can deal with these reports, or because the anti-cheat is simply turned off. Because of these cheaters, the game became unplayable. You know when there is a cheater! With out a cheater, you will die, sure, but you will have kills. But as soon as there is a cheater, your ""skill"" is gone, and you will die, each time you spawn in, with out being able to kill someone. because you're pinned down always. I can imagine the game with out cheaters, and it is a fantastic game, minus the feminist flavor in it. IF I could sue Dice, or even those that creates these cheat engine I would've. There should be also a law that prevents cheating: Those that cheat must pay a high financial sum of money out of their own pocket, and even a year of prison. Many people on the internet however are rejecting that idea, and even dare to ask which punishment would be right, blablabla. These are probably the cheaters talking! I hate the game cheater, not the game. And I blame Dice, even though they don't see it that way. I feel powerless, and that fuels my anger. It is so unfair, and it is very rampant and obnoxious. I demand the developers to turn on anti cheat, I DEMAND it. I am a loyal BF-player, and I and all my mates playing this with out cheats, deserve such change!! It's the only thing we want, I personally don't care anymore that the females are there, you can overlook it. But cheaters are a big no no, and you MUST change that. YOU MUST! We haven't destroyed the game, you did, by allowing cheaters to thrive. With out that BS I would totally give you 3 points! But you are 0.5 points now. This game feels like a psychological attack on the gamer it self. The people that make these games are our enemies. They enforce things with out our consent, add and delete things we never asked for, and pushes an agenda we don't care for, and allow the biggest moral crime you can do to a player in game, using no cheats. the cheater, dominates the map, and bring them players in derision: allowing cheaters, was the foulest thing you've done, after insulting our intelligence with this feminist move to add females at the front line. These females are an Stolen Valor issue, these females never ever seen combat on these battlefields, in these uniforms! Like I said: I would sue you if I could. But I am poor, so I can't. By God I wish I could. Shady mfers!",81.9,2,0

"I've never really liked sandbox games other than vice city. This game is basically GTA set in 1899. I've played GUN back in the day and this is a several steps up from that game. It's fun. I've bought this game since 2020 and only played it like for 9 hours back then. recently had my Rockstar account hacked and been trying the game out a lot since i managed to get back my account with the help of the rockstar support. been super fun. recommended to get this game now. doesn't necessarily need a sale to get, but it's $20 now, so get it while you can.",44.1,0,1

Buying this game equates to not buying the *game*, but rather a broken launcher and 115 GB's of space gone from your drive.",0.3,0,0
"I recently had the incredible opportunity to dive back into the captivating world of Red Dead Redemption on PC, and let me tell you, it was an experience like no other! Having already played this game on my trusty old PS4, I simply couldn't resist the allure of reliving the Wild West saga on a whole new platform. From the moment I booted up the game on my PC, I was greeted with stunning visuals that breathed new life into the already breathtaking landscapes of the American frontier. The attention to detail is nothing short of remarkable, with every sunrise and sunset painting the vast open world in hues that left me in awe. The transition to PC not only enhanced the visual aspects but also brought a newfound fluidity to the gameplay. Whether I was engaged in intense gunfights, exploring the vast wilderness, or embarking on a heart-wrenching mission, the precision and responsiveness of the controls on PC added an extra layer of immersion. However, I did notice a slight hiccup in the form of frame drops when getting close to water, presumably due to the RTX feature. While this didn't significantly detract from the overall experience, it's worth mentioning for those who are sensitive to such nuances. One of the standout features for me was the ability to revisit Arthur Morgan's gripping narrative with enhanced graphics and performance. The characters felt more lifelike than ever, and the emotional depth of the story hit me just as hard the second time around. The PC version truly allows you to appreciate the nuances of the narrative in a way that's hard to achieve on other platforms. The Red Dead Redemption community on PC is also thriving, with mods and user-generated content adding an extra layer of creativity to an already expansive game. It's fantastic to see how the dedicated fanbase continues to contribute to the rich tapestry of the Wild West. In conclusion, playing Red Dead Redemption on PC has been a nostalgic journey that exceeded all expectations. Rockstar Games has truly outdone themselves with this adaptation, and I highly recommend it to both newcomers and veterans of the series.",61.3,0,1

It is SO over run with hackers that whenever you start ANY mission what so ever at all, you get teleported then frozen in lag where all you can do is alt f4 and loose ALL progress you were currently doing. It sucks, because it was such an amazing game. I will never play this game on PC again.. those of you who enjoy playing it still, I strongly suggest console. To the developers-fix your anti cheat for PC. This has gone on for FAR too long and many of us have wasted real life money on this game for this sad excuse - a 2 bit monkey show.",599.4,0,0

"A Masterpiece of Gaming Excellence - Red Dead Redemption 2 Red Dead Redemption 2, developed by Rockstar Games, stands as a testament to the sheer brilliance and artistry that can be achieved in the world of video gaming. This open-world masterpiece is nothing short of a triumph, seamlessly blending a gripping narrative, stunning visuals, and immersive gameplay into an unforgettable experience. First and foremost, the narrative of Red Dead Redemption 2 is a tour de force. Set against the backdrop of the American Wild West, the game follows Arthur Morgan, a complex and morally nuanced protagonist, as he navigates the decline of the outlaw era. The writing is nothing short of exceptional, weaving together a tale of loyalty, betrayal, and redemption that keeps players hooked from start to finish. The character development is unparalleled, with a diverse and memorable cast that brings the world to life. Visually, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a marvel. The attention to detail is staggering, from the sprawling landscapes to the intricate character animations. The game's dynamic weather system and day-night cycle contribute to an ever-changing and living world. Whether riding through the vast plains, exploring dense forests, or engaging in intense gunfights, every moment is a visual feast that showcases the technical prowess of the developers. The gameplay mechanics are equally impressive, offering a perfect blend of action, exploration, and strategic decision-making. From the realistic gunplay to the extensive hunting and crafting system, every aspect of gameplay feels polished and refined. The world is teeming with activities, from poker games in saloons to chance encounters with strangers on the road, ensuring that there's always something to discover in the vast expanse of the game. The attention to historical accuracy is commendable, as Red Dead Redemption 2 authentically captures the spirit of the late 19th century. The meticulous research that went into recreating the time period is evident in the architecture, fashion, and even the dialogue, creating an immersive experience that transports players to a bygone era. The soundtrack, composed by the incredibly talented Woody Jackson, further enhances the emotional resonance of the game. The haunting melodies and atmospheric tunes perfectly complement the narrative, elevating the overall experience and leaving a lasting impact. In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is not just a game; it's a work of art that transcends the boundaries of the medium. Its rich narrative, breathtaking visuals, and engaging gameplay make it a must-play for any gaming enthusiast. Rockstar Games has set a new standard for open-world gaming, and Red Dead Redemption 2 will undoubtedly be remembered as a timeless classic in the industry.",111.3,1,1

"A Masterpiece of Epic Proportions: Red Dead Redemption 2 Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a video game; it's a journey into the heart of the Wild West that leaves an indelible mark on your gaming soul. From the moment you step into the meticulously crafted world of RDR2, you're transported to a time and place where honor, betrayal, and the pursuit of redemption are the driving forces behind an unforgettable narrative. Rockstar Games has outdone themselves with the level of detail poured into every pixel of this open-world masterpiece. The sweeping landscapes, from the dusty plains to the towering mountains, are a testament to the studio's commitment to creating an immersive experience. The dynamic weather system and day-night cycle add a layer of realism that makes each ride through the sprawling wilderness feel like a unique adventure. But it's not just about the breathtaking scenery; it's the characters that breathe life into this virtual frontier. Arthur Morgan, the protagonist, is a complex and morally ambiguous figure whose journey is as heart-wrenching as it is compelling. The supporting cast is equally rich, each with their own stories, quirks, and struggles, creating a tapestry of personalities that make you genuinely care about the fates of those around you. Gameplay mechanics seamlessly blend action, exploration, and storytelling. Whether you're engaged in a thrilling shootout, participating in a high-stakes poker game, or bonding with your trusty steed, every moment feels purposeful. The attention to detail extends to the wildlife, making hunting and fishing not just side activities but integral parts of the survival experience. The soundtrack deserves special mention, as it weaves seamlessly into the narrative, enhancing emotional moments and punctuating the vast, untamed beauty of the world. The music serves as a companion, guiding you through the highs and lows of Arthur's tumultuous journey. Red Dead Redemption 2 isn't just a game; it's an emotional odyssey that stays with you long after the credits roll. It's a testament to the power of storytelling in gaming, an achievement that sets a new standard for open-world adventures. If you're looking for an experience that transcends the boundaries of traditional gaming, saddle up and embark on the journey of a lifetime with Red Dead Redemption 2. You won't be disappointed.",57.2,1,1

"This my first and only review on steam. I have literally been playing video games since the Pong/Atari days. The campaign is literally the best game I have ever played. I haven't done much at all with the multiplayer side of it, so this review is almost entirely about single player campaign. it is a crime that this isn't rated overwhelmingly positive. The Game play is amazing, the attention to detail that the developers/Rockstar put into this game blows away any hopes or expectations I had coming into it. You can literally spend hundreds of hours investigating side quests or interesting things you might stumble upon. You can have as much action as you can handle or you can just relax with some hunting, fishing, domino's with your camp mates, or playing poker in town. To an extent...You can make this game what you want it to be. With all that said...The story is unmatched. You will get invested in it and the characters maybe more than other game. It (some in game characters) will make you angrier than you would believe and situations that will make sadder than you thought a game could (if you've played it...you probably know a couple parts I am talking about). I literally yelled at my monitor ""How dare you make me feel emotions!"" You can play it with high honer or low honor and your game play will change drastically depending how high or low you go, which leads to many players playing it multiple times. So whether your a good guy or your playing as the worst human being ever, there is always a chance for...Redemption. Get it. You wont be sorry. ALSO>>>> Don't join any RDR2 Reddit forums...etc until you have FINISHED your first play through. Don't ruin an amazing story with spoilers.",645.6,1,1

"From what i have played so far of this it is another classic to add into the R* hall of fame. Graphics excellent especially on high end spec pc's, voice acting and music all brilliantly done, story up to now is great, still not completed it yet so will edit this when i have finished it, not really been on multiplayer much so not really going to go into that but i would imagine it is pretty good overall. Even if i was getting this game solely for the single player part of it i would be very very pleased with what there is involved in doing throughout the entire map. Is this better than the last? i would say yes and that is one high standard to be even getting close to. Overall 9.5 (Unfinished as of yet).",36.5,0,1

"I've played the game through on PS4 and it's even more fun on PC. I highly recommend turning the hud, reticle, and auto-aim off for true cowboy immersion. Compared to previous rockstar games Red Dead 2 has the best version of the Euphoria engine. Enemies really react heavily to being shot, and each weapon has a different feel to hit with. Hunting is surprisingly fun and varied, too.",95.3,0,1
The single player game is probably one of the best ive ever played. It has a great story and is just fun. All the side missions are so much fun and hunting and fishing are great. You can get lost in the game. The game is simply beautiful great graphics. The free roam is kind of tough because there aren't a lot of players to do some of the missions so you get stuck. There are a fair amount of people who just mess with you and will dedicate a good chunk of time to just mess with you. The game is deffinatly worth it.,718.5,0,1

"Ribbit! Oh, fellow gamers and amphibian enthusiasts, let me tell you about the mesmerizing experience I had playing Red Dead Redemption 2 on Steam! This game is leaps and bounds beyond your typical gaming experience, and it's all thanks to the charismatic main character, Arthur Morgan. First and foremost, let me croak about Arthur's character development. From the moment you hop into his boots, you can feel the depth and complexity of his personality. His journey is filled with moral dilemmas, tough decisions, and a sense of loyalty that really tugs at your froggy heartstrings. Arthur's story is so well-crafted that you can't help but feel like you're part of the swamp... I mean, gang. The realism in Red Dead Redemption 2 is unparalleled. As a frog with a keen eye for details, I was absolutely ribbited by the stunning landscapes, lifelike wildlife, and the way the mud squishes beneath Arthur's feet. The attention to detail is so hop-tastic that you might find yourself catching flies with your tongue while marveling at the gorgeous sunset in the game. Immersive? Oh, absolutely! The world of Red Dead Redemption 2 is so immersive that you might start feeling like you're a frog on an epic adventure. The dynamic weather, realistic animal behavior, and the bustling life of the towns make you forget you're just sitting on a lily pad playing a video game. It's like I was really there, experiencing the Wild West through the eyes of my virtual amphibious counterpart. And let's not forget the soundtrack – it's jumpin'! The music sets the tone perfectly, whether you're peacefully croaking by the campfire or engaged in a heart-pounding showdown with rival gangs. The atmosphere created by the music is so spot-on that it adds another layer to the already immersive experience. In conclusion, Red Dead Redemption 2 is a riveting adventure that left me croaking for more. Arthur Morgan's character, the breathtaking realism, and the immersive world make this game a true masterpiece. So, fellow gamers, if you haven't hopped on the bandwagon yet, do yourself a favor and experience the wild ride of Red Dead Redemption 2. It's a tadpole-ly awesome time!",127.4,0,1

"Red Dead Redemption 2: A Regressive Trip to the Past Red Dead Redemption 2, the much-hyped sequel to the acclaimed original, has left many players disappointed with its outdated level design, unresponsive controls, and a glaring lack of representation for marginalized communities, specifically BIPOC and LGBTQ+ characters. As the gaming industry progresses towards more inclusive narratives and responsive gameplay, RDR2 seems to stubbornly cling to outdated conventions. Outdated Level Design: One of the most glaring issues with RDR2 is its level design, which feels like a relic from a bygone era. The game world is vast, but it's plagued by tedious and repetitive missions that do little to engage players. The open-world concept, while ambitious, often falls flat due to its lack of dynamic elements. In an industry that has seen groundbreaking advances in level design, RDR2 feels like a missed opportunity to push boundaries and offer a truly immersive experience. Unresponsive Controls: RDR2's control scheme is a frustrating mess that harks back to an era when clunky mechanics were the norm. The sluggish response of the controls makes even the most basic actions feel like a chore. Whether it's navigating the expansive landscapes or engaging in combat, players are left grappling with a control system that fails to keep up with the expectations set by more modern titles. Lack of BIPOC and LGBTQ+ Representation: In an age where representation matters more than ever, RDR2 falls woefully short. The game takes place in a diverse historical setting, yet it seems the developers missed the memo on inclusive storytelling. The absence of meaningful BIPOC and LGBTQ+ characters is not only a disservice to the richness of the game's historical context but also a missed opportunity to create a more authentic and relatable narrative. The gaming industry has evolved, and RDR2's failure to reflect this is a disappointment to those seeking diverse and inclusive experiences. Desperate Need for Representation: The lack of BIPOC and LGBTQ+ representation in RDR2 isn't just a minor oversight—it's a significant flaw that taints the entire gaming experience. The developers missed a chance to shed light on the diverse stories of the American West, opting instead for a tired and one-dimensional portrayal. In an era where players demand games that reflect the real world, RDR2's refusal to acknowledge and celebrate the experiences of marginalized BIPOC and LGBTQ+ communities feels like a step backward. Conclusion: Red Dead Redemption 2, despite its impressive visuals and attention to detail, fails to live up to the standards set by contemporary gaming. Its outdated level design, unresponsive controls, and lack of BIPOC and LGBTQ+ representation make it a disappointing entry in an industry that is increasingly embracing diversity and innovation. As players yearn for more inclusive narratives and responsive gameplay, RDR2 stands as a testament to the risks of clinging to outdated conventions in a rapidly evolving gaming landscape. 2/10",50.3,0,0

"(I'm writing this review way before finishing the game, just to get the 2023 Steam Awards XP. At 74 hours played, I've completed almost 20% of the story missions and about 38% total completion of the single player portion. Didn't touch Online yet _ I'm certain I will play this for over 200 hours. Will update when I'm done.) Despite this being a shooter (1st or 3rd person, up to you), to me it's ultimately a chill game. It's slow like the time it portrays. It's wonderful to just roam through the big map (I'm far from seeing it all), looking at the beautiful scenery. The fauna is awesome: so many animals to study and hunt for the perfect pelts (not as good as the hunting system in the masterpiece ""Kingdom Come: Deliverance"" , though). There's so much to explore and to look for, so many little events to shake things up a little. This virtual world feels alive. What impresses me the most is the gang's camp. All the time the NPCs interact with you and with each other. There's always something interesting to see: Dutch preaching or listening to his gramophone; Susan ordering people around or complaining about the girls; Marston and Abigail fighting, while Jack is bored; Javier playing his guitar (sometimes you can join in the singing _ some of the songs are delightedly raunchy); reverend Swanson being drunk or crazy; Hosea giving advice to a youngster; Uncle being Uncle etc. When you play domino, there's always some initial banter; feels like you're playing with a friend. I just miss the option of cheating when playing poker. The tone is the most straight I've seen in a Rockstar game. Their ironic sense of humor is still there, but it's way more subtle. It's a far more mature narrative, although their usual ""everyone around is even crazier than you"" model lives on. I'm not very much into shooters and the shooting is the worst part. It's outdated and not particularly exciting. I'm not a fan of the Dead Eye, it feels gamey in the wrong way. I'm playing with a controller with no aim assist, to make it more challenging and interesting, but still I've been dreading the missions that involve shootouts (they bore me very quickly). The duel system doesn't satisfy me either. In all of the Rockstar games, this feels like it's the least fun to cause havoc. It's like you're supposed to keep your nose cleaner this time _ I'm all right with that, but unfortunately they don't go all the way; imagine what a peaceful run would be like? It's also the most forgiving Rockstar game I've played. was already too easy for my taste, but this just lets you skip mission checkpoints after you die 3 or 4 times. Again, feels like the game was made to be relaxing. So far, the only really challenging parts I've found are the encounters with packs of wolves; the way they circle you and don't let you shoot them is lethal. Since I'm still in chapter 2, there's not much to say about the story yet. I'm confident it will pick up, but so far the story missions are the least fun part. For that reason, I suppose I'll enjoy Online more than I did on ""GTA V"", but let's see about that. Thanks for reading.",75.3,1,1

"Birkaç gün önce Steam'in dolar kuruna geçiş yapmasıyla artık oyun almanın lüksten öteye geçtiği ülkemizde önceden satın aldığımız belki de hiç şans vermediğimiz oyunları değerlendirmenin en mantıklı seçenek olduğu bir döneme geçiş yaptık. Geçiş yaptık ama ben maalesef ki ben eski yeni bakmadan hatıramda yüksek yere sahip oyunlara dönmeye devam ediyorum. Bu oyunların çoğunun altında Rockstar imzası bulunması da şaşırtıcı gelmiyor haliyle çünkü her içeriğin hayalkırıklığı yarattığı bu dönemde istisnasız ustalık eserleri çıkartmaya devam eden sayılı şirketlerden biri kendileri. GTA 6'nın duyurulması ve muhtemelen bu incelemeden bir iki hafta sonra trailerının yayımlanmasıyla yeni bir oyunun hype'ını sonuna kadar yaşamadan önce (Türkiye'deki standartlara rağmen) akla hayale sığmayan detay derecesiyle sizi en iyi yazılmış karakterlerden birinin yerine koyan bu muazzam başyapıt zaman mekan farketmeden herkesin deneyimlemesi gereken harika ötesi bir oyun.

"I played this game when it first came out on xbox. Loved it. 10/10 but now... on pc.. just trying to be nostalgic and bought it on sale. dont do it. Its insanely difficult to mod and you cant save in Single player with cheats. seriously. Im just in awe. id return it if the damn prologue didint take 3 HOURS to complete. I just want to have an easy going story based experience where i don't have to grind for a month to get a fancy purse..... is that too much to ask? well if youre rockstar the answer is ""yes and we hate you * spit * "" im still going to play it. a little here and a little there and maybe ill fined a decent way to manually save my damn game with cheats but im incredibly frustrated. if you're not like me and want to play the base game and only the base game. yah pick it up for under $30 if you can. online mode is garbage and you wont be able to ever use God mode or add extra cash in your pocket but the base game does stand on its own. just not the experience i want revisiting a game in 2023.",6.9,0,0

"Product received for free I had planned to write an extensive review of Red Dead Redemption 2, but before I do, let me just say that if you enjoy open-world games with excellent graphics and haven't played this game yet, then stop reading and buy it now. I would hate to spoil the joy of discovering what this game has to offer. Red Dead Redemption 2 is a sequel-prequel to the original game, and based on my experience, it surpasses its predecessor in every aspect. Unfortunately, the original game was never released on PC, denying PC gamers the chance to experience it. Despite the latest remaster of Red Dead Redemption not being available on PC, I'm glad that Rockstar decided to release Red Dead Redemption 2 on PC. I played the Steam version of Red Dead Redemption 2 in 2023 on a powerful machine with an i7 12700k processor, GeForce RTX 3080Ti graphics card, and 64GB of RAM, running at 3440x1440 on the highest graphics settings. The game ran smoothly at mostly 60-70FPS with DLSS set to Quality. For those with less powerful machines, I recommend enabling DLSS, as this game is resource-intensive. The game's visuals are stunning, with its open-world environment spanning different settings, from snowy mountains to great plains, redwood forests, swamps, and the desert landscape of the Southern United States and Mexico. The weather system adds to the immersion, such as riding your horse on the great plains during a thunderstorm. In terms of visual design, Red Dead Redemption 2 surpasses even The Witcher 3. However, it's not just the visuals that make this game great. Its level of interactivity, side quest design, variety of gameplay, interesting characters, and Easter Eggs contribute to the overall experience. Rockstar's talent is evident when compared to other open-world games, such as those created by UbiSoft, which lack the same level of creativity and originality. Despite the amount of focus given to creating a stunning open world, one might assume that Rockstar overlooked the importance of the game's storyline. However, this is not the case. The game's story is well-crafted and engaging, which is no easy feat considering the campaign is over 50 hours long. The voice acting is arguably the best I have ever experienced in any video game, even surpassing that of The Witcher 3 and Cyberpunk 2077. While I won't delve into the specific details of the story, I can assure you that it is exceptionally well done, with one of the most memorable final acts I've experienced in any game to date. While the game is undoubtedly impressive overall, there are certain areas where it falls short, especially on the PC. The UX design feels subpar and gives the impression that it was created by someone who has never played games on a computer before. The menu navigation is frustrating and overly complicated. To switch between weapons, you need to hold Tab and press Q and E, which is a poor design choice. It would have been better to use an inventory option similar to that for items that you are carrying instead of the clunky weapon wheel. The game has some mechanics that are quite unusual, especially the weapon system. As a player, you have two slots for long guns - the shoulder slot and the back slot. However, when you are riding a horse, the character puts away the weapons, and they become ""horse weapons"". When you dismount from the horse, the weapons should teleport back onto you, but sometimes that doesn't happen. This can be frustrating, especially when you need to quickly engage enemies and you realized that you no longer have the weapons you previously equipped. It would be easier if the weapons stayed on your person all the time. It's unclear why this feature was added to the game in the first place. Customizing your outfits is another clunky mess of navigating multiple menus, and then having to store these outfits on the horse. Why? Other games have solved this problem. There was no reason to try and reinvent the wheel here. A lot of effort appears to have gone into making animation for simple actions, and while impressive at first, they can become repetitive and dull after several hours of gameplay. There is also no quick save. Thankfully there is a manual save option, but that doesn't quite work the way one might intuitively think it might. The lack of quick save option is unacceptable for an open-world game. To add insult to injury, you need to create a Rockstar account to play the game, which launches via the Rockstar Game Launcher after launching the game via Steam. This double DRM process needs to be eliminated. There is no good reason for game companies to require paying customers to jump through hoops to play a game. Pure corporate greed. I am definitely nitpicking here with my complaints (except for double DRM which is just the worst), because in spite of these annoyances, I played this game for over 190 hours, and I am still not done yet. There are more places to explore, and more animals to hunt, and bounties to collect. The last Rockstar game I played was GTA IV, which I hated due to the atrocious requirement of Games For Windows Live and other technical issues with the PC port. I had very little hope for Red Dead Redemption 2 on the PC, but despite their best efforts, it turned out to be a fantastic game. Now, I am eagerly waiting for Red Dead Redemption 3, which I hope to play in 2030.",193.3,1,1

"I've just beat the game (82%) for the second time. RDR2 is an incredible game that is a must play if you have 60-70 hours to invest in it. Its slower paced gameplay may not be for everyone, but if you are interested in a deeply immersive and character driven game, I strongly recommend this.",131.0,0,1
"Great game. One of the best games I've played. I just reached half of the single player story, and I already have played 50+ hours. It is such a giant step from GTA V in every sense. The graphics look photorealistic, performance is great, running on average at 70-80fps with an RX6600, Ryzen 5500 (1440p). Haven't really played online that much, but I think the performance there is also great, compared to GTA V. The story is way more mature, lets you see that not everything is black and white, as well as showing the rawness of 1899. They have no issue in showing awful scenarios that you would see in real life. Random events are way more and better than the ones GTA V has. They are very unpredictable. You don't know if you should help someone, because it all could've been a trap. Dificulty is higher than other Rockstar games. Melee combat feels real and dynamic. Enemies can kill you easily, and the AI has improved a lot. Even though the classic Rockstar formula is still there, I think I've enjoyed most missions compared to GTA V. Until now, there is not a mission that I can say I would remove from the game. Most of them feel epic and do have a purpose. And the ones that might seem like ""filler"" still have some charm to them. Definitely recommending this game.",56.5,0,1

"This game is such an adventure from start to finish, and despite rushing after Chapter 5, it recovers all the hype that was building up on Chapter 4, i've never felt so emotional ending a game as i felt with this one, not even the first entry punched my guts like this, there's just such an exquisite delivery whenever a turning point for Arthur comes. ""Take a gamble that love exists, and do a loving act!"" One can complain about the slow nature of the gameplay, even more with all these animations playing when you do something, or the Euphoria engine kicking your ass whenever you want to go up a slope, but it compliments the grounded nature of this title compared to others made by Rockstar, such as GTA. The gunplay isn't the most groundbreaking in the industry, if you're playing on a controller, you'll probably end up using the autoaim feature. You'll soon end up roaming around Valentine, enjoying the still wild west, or walk the streets of Saint Denis and have a taste of things to come in the new era of civilization.

"Over the years, I’ve played quite a few games that I can confidently say are masterpieces, Witcher 3 Wild Hunt, Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild and The Elder Scrolls: Skyrim, Assassins Creed 2, Life Is Strange etc. But rarely have I have never played a game that balances it’s narrative and its open world gameplay so perfectly like RDR2. It has the most alive and interactive open world in all of gaming, one of the best stories ever told, some of the most well written characters you’ll ever find in games and finally, it has Arthur Morgan. The Open World Rockstar managed to make the most alive open world in a game where most of the land is empty. How did they achieve that? By making it interactive in every way imaginable. Every NPC, every animal, every plant can by interacted with in unique and interesting ways. These NPCs are real people with lives that go on in the world when you are not around. They have schedules, jobs they have to go to, families to take care of. You can choose to be friendly, not so friendly, rob or kill these people and every time you choose any of these options, they react to it in a unique way. When you kill an NPC, they don’t just respawn, that particular character is gone forever. When you act friendly or help an NPC, they will remember your kindness and repay you if you come across them again. The artificial intelligence is so advanced that I find it crazy that not many studios have managed to replicate it even now, 5 years later. Rockstar knows how to keep these long stretches of emptiness interesting. That is by adding random events that can happen around you while traveling across this world. These events can range from helping a drunk find his way back home to stopping a huge train robbery. You can choose to ignore these events of course. That brings us to the honour system, you can choose to play as a bad guy or a good guy and it affects how people react to you in the world and in the story. It also affects what ending you get. There is also a witness system. When you commit a crime when there is someone around and they see you, they’ll rush to the law. You can choose to bribe this witness or kill them before they report on you. Hunting, skinning and crafting is also a very important part of this game. All this doesn’t need to be here because this is not a survival game or an RPG but rockstar added it anyway for further immersion. RDR2 has some of the most impressive animations I’ve ever seen. Every action has a unique animation, many see this as a problem because even the smallest tasks can drag on because Arthur has to complete those animations but I did not care. There’s a unique animation for skinning every species of animal, looting bodies, searching chests etc. Arthur’s beard grows gradually as days in game passes and you can trim it anyway you like or just let it grow using a hair tonic. Let’s not forget the highly detailed first-person animations as well. It’s so detailed that riding a horse in first-person can be quite nauseating. All this makes sure that you are fully immersed in this world. RDR2 follows a gang of outlaws on the run after a robbery gone wrong. Now they have to make enough money to get out the country and retire. That’s the basic premise of the game, but as these stories tend to go, things don’t go so smoothly. What makes this narrative work is the characters in it. RDR2 has characters with deep personalities, interesting back stories and a purpose beyond just being plot objects. You connect with every gang member like they are your family. This world is brutal so there is always a sense of danger. The story takes you to a lot of interesting places like plains, deep forests, swamps, small towns, tribal settlements and an industrial city. All these places are extremely detailed and filled with interesting characters to meet. Anyway, let’s just say you will be coming out of this story having experienced a ride of a lifetime. As a side note, you absolutely don’t need to play Red Dead 1 to enjoy this game, this is a prequel and requires no knowledge of the first game. But if you have played it, you will recognise a lot of faces and that’s nice. In my many years of gaming, I have come across some amazing video game protagonists. Niko Bellic, Ezio Auditore, Agent 47, Kratos and Geralt of Rivia are all characters I will remember till the day I die. Now after completing RDR2, I can confidently say that Arthur Morgan is my favourite protagonist of all time. It’s so hard to describe Arthur, he’s not the chosen one, an anti-hero or a good guy. He’s a flawed man who, deep inside has a sense of morality and always acknowledges that what he’s doing is always not the right thing. Arthur is driven by his love for his gang member and sense of loyalty to Dutch Van Der Linde. He deeply cares for the characters around him and you slowly see how he changes for the better or for worse as the story goes on. Your choices affect what character you want Arthur to be but it doesn’t completely change him. If you play as low honour Arthur, he wont just do evil things for fun, he will still have a sense of morality and that can be reflected in his words. Even if you have the choice of being a bad man, playing as high honour Arthur is the most sensible option because you know deep down that’s what he wants. Every interaction Arthur has with characters, NPCs and even his horse is memorable. There is an enitre mission where you go drinking with your gang members and you get to see what kind of a person Arthur really is under that stoic persona he puts on. He’s not a wise guy spitting out wise quotes or a guy who makes jokes every chance he gets, he’s not a good speaker and cannot give motivational speeches. He is just a relatable guy that you wouldn’t mind hanging out and sharing your problems with. I thought Rockstar had peaked with Niko in GTA 4 but I’m glad I was wrong. Arthur Morgan will always have a special place in my heart. But nothing is perfect, so there are some minor nitpicks I have with this game. The missions are very linear compared to the amount of freedom you get in the open world. There were some hilarious bugs that I found like Arthur’s gun getting stuck to hand and beard growing out of nowhere while talking to someone. Most of these are flaws of real-time cut scenes but they didn’t really bother me. The economy of the game is a bit unfair, selling doesn’t give you a lot of money unless it’s a specific shop or fence. The fast travel system is too complicated. But that’s so that you are encouraged to go on long rides. Arthur’s weight system is really not needed. The Rockstar Launcher is as annoying as always and adds another 30 seconds to the boot time. I didn’t touch Red Dead Online, so can’t comment on that. All these don’t really bother me but I listed them here anyway since this is a review. That brings me to the end of this review. As you can see, I absolutely love this game with all my heart and I highly recommend it to everyone who still hasn’t played it. It is absolutely worth every penny.",106.3,1,1

I have never felt so in touch with a character and felt the same emotions they are feeling. The way the whole mood of the game changes as the story progresses is staggering. I have never played a game so well-paced. so rich in story and so fun all at the same time until. Mate of mine said 'not to oversell it but. It changes you.'

Imagine game with great story in marvelous landscape with detailed wildlife and several side activities which could easily surpass GTA ...and then screw up everything! Let the horses move oposite direction, make menus slow to navigate and controls change as you go, disarm player after every cutscene or give him unfitting gun for a task, force him to travel land of freedom on restricted line, crafting and table games have slow pace which might be realistic but it gets tedious and you will need dumb Rockstar launcher to play this atrocity at all. Even in discount think twice about dealing with this one because it will get you livid which is just sad because authors made realy great stories, visuals, animation and voiceacting just for some glue-munching muppet to ruin their work.",170.2,0,0

"BEST $40 i've ever spent. i bought this game on xbox, then on PC a month later just to experience it again but better. cmon, just buy it, you won't regret it. ever since i first played it, Skyrim has been my favourite game of all time and nothing has compared. RDR2 immediately became even with it. i watched my older brother play RDR sooo many times, and when RDR2 released i was so hyped and watched him play it too...but playing it yourself, years later after forgetting most everything, is an entirely different experience. i was in a terrible mental state when i decided to finally buy this game because of Tenacious D. I was isolated for 4 months, and this game is the one and only thing that got me out of that depression. I could immerse myself so well, that for a while it felt like my own happy place where I could finally escape the world. It still is. My entire life, I've always adored cowboys. My lifelong dream has been exactly what this game is, playing it helped me live that a little, even if it ain't real. It changed my view on the world and our society entirely, and it gave me a new appreciation for emotion and nature. I started a photography account for this game, because it got me back into my hobby years after i dropped it. I made 2 new online friends thanks to this game, and I talk to them both nearly every day. The characters inspired me to start drawing again, and I've improved 100x with my art by drawing them. I went from being completely unable to draw men, to ONLY able to draw men. ♥♥♥♥, my Halloween costume this year was Dutch. I barely have the time to play it anymore, and that kills me. Every time I play it now, whenever i FINALLY have some time, I end up crying because I missed it so damn much... This game turns me into one big baby as soon as I see the start menu. Anyway, this game has helped me heal in so many ways I didn't know I needed. Skyrim may still be my #1, but RDR2 is THE best game of all time.",29.2,0,1

"RDR2 is completely immersive and open world. Pros: *Good game mechanics and combat. *Dialogues are well written and immersive, gives the player a good experience. *Combat and customisation of weapons and accessories are brilliant and I personally like them all. *The map is huge with insane side quests and treasure hunts which require to use brains and pose a good challenge. *Finally I like the graphics and the NPC interactions with the main player. It feels real. Cons: *Poor story line with hardly any changes throughout the game. It follows one individual in search of money. That's it and it keep revolving around that same. *Being such a rich open world they could have merged some side quests with the main story and made it more interesting. *The ending for me is kind of anti climatic with no real substance or attachment to the main character. I would recommend this game in case you like open world and side quests. A lot to do apart from the main story as well.",144.9,0,1

But when I started to play, random people in lobby which are unkillable for some reason, started to teleport to me and kill me over and over again. As a Gta Online player, I was very hearthbroken when I realized online version of this game is not being checked by developers so they can do something about this (They also don't care about Gta Online). As a result, I'll simply start playing single player and maybe, maybe if my friends will join I'll think about playing Online. I don't recommend online mode to anyone.

"Overall, Elden Ring was a positive experience for me. The variety of spells and equipment it offers and the amount of builds you can do makes it one of those games worth revisiting despite its length, while the non-linear structure of the open world allows you to make your new adventure flow completely different from the previous one. Unfortunately, Elden Ring is not without its issues, and at least for me personally, there's quite many. I won't go into every detail since I admit that a lot of them may come down to a preference, but here's two big problems I believe most people who've also played the game will agree on: - By the second half of your playthrough it will become very noticable how the game almost crumbles under its own size, which results in repeating enemies, dungeons and bosses (not to mention the fact that FromSoftware already reuse some of the content from their previous games). I understand that it was a compromise to keep the world as big as it is, but it also doesn't make interacting with those on repeating encounters any less dull. - The quest system in this game is pure nonsense (and no, this isn't me advocating for the introduction of quest markers). First, in many cases, once you progress a quest to the next stage, the NPC you're looking for will move to a completely different place on the map without giving you even a slight indication where to find them. Secondly, the directions they give you for their tasks are often vague at best too and often you won't even realize you did or found something that can prompt another interaction (e.g. Sorceress Sellen's quest line). Basically, the probability of you finishing some of the quests in Elden Ring comes down to pure luck, unless you're following a guide. It's the opposite extreme I'm not a fan of, but FromSoftware pretty much force you to choose between the two. I could go on and on about the issues I listed above, as well as some of the more subjective ones, but I think this review is long enough as it is. Like I said in the beginning, I had a good time with Elden Ring, and despite its problems, I think the game is well worth your time and the asking price.",146.9,0,1

"*start price hike rant I bought this for full price like 1,999.95 PHP and was happy that it's not price the same with other AAA game so I bought right away and was my birthday gift to myself. Now it's price is higher than usual not just this one but all other games even long after they where release. What's happening with steam prices? Instead of people wanting to buy their games. People might go back into piracy because of this ridiculous price jumps. But I'm probably just the minority. *end price hike rant Game Review If you want a better but not so hard Dark Soul's game this is it. The summons in each bosses helps a lot to mitigate the boss difficulty which I am really thankful as I play solo. Story is not much to desire but passable Gameplay just takes the cake Graphics is not stunning but great Game Length you would not need to spend much time if you will spend just finishing the story So I recommend this if you like a challenge.

"what a master piece of lore and game play it's damn near perfect in every way shape or form , you will never know what will wait you in the next corner of the region all is interconnected and all is linked together , you will start a lonely lost tarnished , maiden-less, then your journey to the glory will start to become elden lord, once the journey is finished you will feel like you truly deserved the title , and even more wanting to do the journey again , this game truly make me feel the appeal in new game + , as you will want to know what its like to conquer the land that you are its lord after reaching that statues at the end of your first run , this game transforms you from pathetic tarnished into the great lord you once heard about. 100/10 would definitely recommend",129.4,0,1

"Although I played a few hours, I don't think I would recommend this game to anyone. I also never played any other ""souls-like"" games. I think this is highly overrated. There are some pros and many cons, but i would only like to point out some of the main issues for me: This game is very grindy. Its not obvious at first sight when a mob will attack, and when you need to time your dodge. For example when a monster lift its arm, it can be a sign of an immediate attack, or it can also mean that the attack will only be a few seconds later, so you use your dodge too early and die. When you see the actual attack animation, its sometimes so fast, that you cant react to it, its already too late, so you need to do the dodge before the actual attack starts. You kinda have to try it out on yourself, and memorize every attack move of that monster (of every monster basically). They can kill you in one or two hits, so you will find yourself dying to the same monster again and again and again, until you finally remember enough moves to dodge enough attacks to kill them. The combat skillset is also very dry: you basically do two moves: dodge, and quick attack. Although there are unique skills in the game, you can only use one at a time, but most of them are just a slightly stronger but slower attack, which will be interrupted anyways when you take damage, and never go off, so you wont really use them. Not much variety, every fight looks the same through all game. You just grind the required attack timing informations, then you dodge the attacks, and do one or two quick attacks when the opportunity comes, and you repeat this until the hp bar of the mobs are depleted. You can interrupt the attacks of weaker enemies, so if you fight just one at a time, you can spam quick attack and win quickly but in a smilarily boring way as you die to stronger mobs. Or you can play as mage, and kill everything easily spamming one or two different spells the whole game. Many basic information of equipment or skills/ game mechanics are not displayed in the game, so for example if you are interested in the full stats of a specific weapon (for example how well it staggers enemies), you need to look for online guides and databases to find it out, because the game just dont tells you. Same is true about the story. You dont really know what is going on around you, there is very limited ingame storytelling, just a lot of similar sounding names, (eg. Melenia, Melina, Miquela, Marika, Margith, Morgott) with one or two line of cryptic sounding reference to one of the many events you never heared before. There are a lot of unjust situations, for example once i was teleported to a different area by a trap, and the game didnt let me get out of that place via teleporting, even dying wouldnt send me back, i respawned there. Unfortunately it was a later game area with strong, and very annoying mobs. Normally if you encounter a too strong area for you, you can just go to a different place, but this time i was forced to play there until i found the exit manually, what only happened after a great deal of frustration.",58.4,0,0

"This game is way too unfair, if you don't spend at least 1000 hours on this game, every boss will one shot you in the first second of the boss fight and the healing mechanism is SUPER trash. It takes three years to heal once, then when you finish healing you're already dead. Plus, when you START healing the enemy or boss will immediately come running straight to you and when they hit you you will have to heal AGAIN. I wont spoil the boss that does this, but there is an attack that you cannot dodge. And don't even get me started on the mimic tears A.I. The mimic is actually a great choice for bosses but the A.I takes every hit and doesn't even live for a quarter of the boss. ABSOLUTE GARBAGE GAME.",526.7,0,0

"Open world dark souls combining many features from the older titles into one giant overarching seamless experience. Overall the game is a bit easier than previous entries made by fromsoft, but at the same time it has it's moments of riveting boss experiences despite some content seemingly not being exactly unique, overall I think while this game can be a bit grindy or slow, the difficulty that accommodates these titles is still present should you choose to play that way. TLDR: Game is a 10/10 just make sure to play with a controller for the best experience",100.9,0,1

"Coming back to this game you can feel the level of care that went into making it, classic FromSoft formula as always, with many changes that they took their time to make sure make sense in the whole game before implementing them, Open World done right for one of the first times in my entire life. I can write on and on about the perfection of FromSoft games in delivering the most cohesive game experiences you could possibly find out there, from the perfect marriage of the lore to the mechanics and your actual game experience. Unlike some other games where there's a disconnect between the story and the real game-play. The experience also of doing side quests alongside your main objective is quite enjoyable. You're barely affected by missing out on this content whatsoever, but it makes for solid replayability. All fork choices and their consequences on the world have been well-thought out and there has never been any glitch I could find where I could reach some kind of dead-end in a quest that hasn't been accounted for. 100% recommended, obviously not for everyone if you're not into the original FromSoft games, but It is a lot more beginner friendly IMO.",223.6,0,1

I have flipped and I have flopped about this game. I love to play the mage in most games and I tried it here. It doesn't have the ability to play a straight mage like an Elder Scrolls game. Magic will be a secondary part to most builds until you have the levels and the spells. But I urge you to *try* the game and just play it. Try not to look up things BUT DO IT IF IT WILL STOP YOU FROM FINISHING THIS GAME. It IS difficult and I'm sure a souls vet will tell me that there's others that are harder and I'm sure there are.

"Elden Ring is a fairly difficult souls-like game but the replay-ability of the game is immaculate, even if you've beaten it three times there's always more to find, more quests to do, etc. I have 159 hours in it currently with playing on my own and the seamless Co-Op mod and I've had nothing but fun with Elden Ring. It is one of my favorite games and the design is beautiful. For those who enjoy the deep secretive lore of games like Boneworks, you'll enjoy Elden Ring as well. The story is scattered across the entire game and then some. The major story is lied out infront of you as you play through the game and gather great runes but for in depth history, you have to do some hunting. I highly recommend Elden Ring and I guarantee you'll break your keyboard out of rage whilst always coming back to it like an addiction.",160.0,0,1

"Bandai-Namco is the worst. They make Console games, NOT pc games, and more unfortunately, they then port said console games to PC, but do it so badly that it hurts play. This game is designed for a controller, and bandai-namco's attempts to emulate controller commands with a mouse and keyboard follow the standard bandai-namco failure routine. THings that are normally handled with a mouse are forced onto WASD because they can't be bothered to properly program the mouse and menus. For example, scrolling around the map is done with WASD rather than the mouse.. It's utterly Asinine in today's day and age. It's like playing a retro game from 20 years ago... Everything is hidden behind context menus that work great for a controller, but terribly for a keyboard/mouse. With a controller, WASD is handled by a single thumb, leaving the other fingers free to hold down bumpers and modifiers. With a keyboard, wasd is handled by three fingers, with run on shift and jump on space, leaving NOTHING for holding down alt or E or Q, etc, making the fact that most of your needed commands are hidden beneath a press and hold, plus the activation key, nearly impossible to accomplish properly and in time, meaning MANY MANY DEATHS DUE TO BAD INPUT DESIGN.",296.3,2,0

"I would give this a thumbs up. Played Dark Souls 3 after this one and realized that Elden Ring is just a better and advanced version of DS3. Controls are better ( i played it using gamepad and i'm not sure what controls are on keyboard probably not the best ) dodge and blocking with shield is apperently better since in contrast to DS3 you cannot be stabbed in the back while blocking. Camera lock has longer range and is not switched off in most significant moments. Ther is a lot's of exploration in sense when you see something from afar and try to figure out how to get there, then at the end of this path you get a spell or a weapon which feels rewarding. Bosses are interesting ones and fights with them fell like you actually in intense fight and not just mashing buttons. What i would like to highlight laso is that the game is really huge. Still there is stuff that i didnt like. For example one type of a dragon with red lightning for which camera lock was working only on his head and not legs as opposed to other dragons making fight with him artificially difficult. Quests are too cryptic and without searching internet you are not able to pass them properly unfortunately. Also what bothered me is a multiplayer part of the game. You can play coop but you have to constantly reconnect to a friend. But the actual networking connection part is bugged. When you are invaded there might be a lot of lag going on. There is also PVP which looks actually pretty fun when networking connection works. In conclusion i would like to say that you can buy it for single player expirince, but if you buy it for PVP or multiplayer expect lots of networking issues.",224.1,1,1

"I was absolutely captivated by this game's visual style and gameplay, mostly because this game was the first From Software game I ever played. It even appeared to be a revelation, for I found myself very keen on the soulslike genre and bought and walked though DS1 already, which is a fantastic game. It was curious for me to discover the difference of these two games, and how much progress FS made since then. I spent 147 playing the main story and got all the achievements (almost all, the fact that I have to walk through it again two more times is the only drawbag I found, though it may become a reason for me to wald through it again in the future), and I can't wait to play the coming DLC. I recommend Elden Ring if you would like to discover soulslike games with know doubt. All else who have played any of FS' games already know that this game's terrific",147.4,0,1

The lessons learned from Sekiro, Bloodborne, and the Dark Souls series reflects highly on the punishing yet fair gameplay that FromSoftware continues to execute gracefully on. Not only is the gameplay to the ""Golden Order"" standard, the soundtrack as well as the visuals of the game are exactly what you would expect from a studio that has given many countless hours of fun and fear year after year.",248.9,0,1

"First time souls player - Thought I would give it a go since Elden Ring was so popular, must be a good reason right? What happened was something I did not expect. Today when I tell people I love video games they ask ""oh cool, what's your favorite game?"" I never had an answer because I have played so many games I could never narrow it down. Then one day, like a light coming on, I realized it. My favorite game is Elden Ring and I didn't even know it. How did I figure it out? I was curious one day and started looking at my play times. 300 hours played on PS4 and currently over 123 hours on PC. Not only do I have 423 hours of game play, I bought it on two systems. Elden Ring IS the best 3rd person action RPG I have ever played. The world is beautiful and weird, the story is vague and action can be challenging at times. I love the loot system, I love the freedom to wear whatever armor you want, the massive freedom to play the game in any style you want, and I will never get tired of the critical back stabs. They are beyond satisfying. Elden Ring is not a difficult game, people who say that just don't understand the game play. It took me about 10 hours to get use to the controls, and 50 hours before I ""got it"". Things like, its not a hack and slash, and you can't stand still and trade blows with most enemies. Keep moving, standing still is a bad idea, and most enemies have combo attacks and enough poise to finish them without being interrupted. Knowing those 3 things will help tremendously when you start the game. Elden Ring is a very deep game, I'm still learning new things about NPCs and the lore 2 years later. I love it and I can't wait for the DLC, its a day ONE purchase for me.",131.3,2,1

"This game is amazing, with that out of the way lets continue i have never before played a fromsoft game or a souls like from anyone else. this game was my first experience with the developers and i enjoyed every second of it after i got over my fear of the game and ideas that im ""just not good"" id heard about and all the souls players talk, guess what they arent that bad and the games arent either. i have pumped 291HRS into this game and completed it twice with and without summons as a new to the game style player and i will tell you now the difficulty is entirely up to you as the player for the vast majority of the 60 to 120HRS of your play through to complete any story line you are going for. my first time i dived into the lads between i made my way quickly to the first major boss and got my ass kicked thinking i would be the ""HERO OF TIME"" or something like that only to find i would need to become way more powerful on my own rather than be brandished by a particular name and one all mighty sword. it took me hours but i found a few cheats on the low level ways to get good, you can farm items,weed the fields for materials, hunt wild life, and practice on low level enemies and sell all gains for runes to level if that's hurting your progress. the biggest point of the first boss is to push players to explore and for all of the game you will gain the most doing so, so please come explore the lands between it is very rewarding",291.0,0,1

"As a standalone game: 5-6/10 As a Souls game: 2/10 Played since the original Demon Souls and there hasn't been an entry in the franchise that has such inconsequential bosses, but which also relies heavily on cheap mechanics to create faux difficulty. Healing is too accessible, which pushes bosses to do more damage to remain a threat, ruining the tense pacing of previous titles. There's also a tendency for the player to chase the boss rather than the other way, allowing for plenty rest breaks in most fights. Being open-world hasn't added anything to the genre but has robbed the world of its tension. When you can just get on your horse and skip most of the game the smaller enemies lose all credibility. The optional areas lack threat, which wouldn't be as much of a problem if the enemies weren't copies, but these issues together creates very stale, tedious, and ultimately forgettable experience in those areas, It absolutely rains bonfires; It's not unusual to have 5 bonfires within 2 minutes or less of each other. Combined with fast travel from anywhere and the previous note on the horse there's no weight to travel either, absolutely no risk to your souls or progression. The game is fine enough to play, but it has lost a lot of what makes a Souls game.",51.8,3,0

I should also mention, if you enjoyed the way that Fromsoft tell their story's you won't be disappointed with what you find out from lore tidbits and quest/npc dialog. I thoroughly enjoyed it and can't wait for Shadow of The Erdtree DLC!",327.2,0,1

"Writing this review is difficult for me. As a Souls Fan, having played all the Demon/Dark Souls games, I was hyped to Start a new adventure on the PC. The game looks beautiful, the mechanics works great and exploring the lands were interesting in the begining. I took some time to beat the Tutorial Boss with the wretch class. This Challenge would prepare me for what was about to come, but already showed me a bit the difference with Elden Ring. I cant really put the thumbs on the issue, but the balancing of the enemies and the bosses felt off. Many of the bosses, which for example didnt Start in Limgrave, would be beaten in the first try, while Semi Bosses like crucible knights would whoop the floor with me. Most of the bosses are big monstrosities, which can still do like 30 backflips and sideslides in a row to pierce you from behind. Camera is still a big problem, especially with the big bosses like giants or Dragons. When you have to attack around the ankles, you fight more with the Camera hoping to See, from where the attack will come. Also a anoying feature were those delayed Attacs, trying to bait you into rolling too early. Souls games always felt Hard but fair. With Elden Ring, I sometimes didnt have that feeling. While for example the Godskin Duo Was beaten first try, it took me a couple hours to fight of the Crucible Knights Duo. Those enemies would run after me full circle and spaming poise Breaking attacks one after the other. After discovering the third Land, the size of the maps started to wear down. I would Start to run through sections with torrent, because discovery and fighting would take too much time. The scale was unnecessary high and felt with the story shortage quite empty. The Options to buy the +7/+8 stone to Upgrade the Weapon up to +24 could have come a bit earlier and not on the last map. It Made the changing and testing of weapons more difficult. In the end I was able to get all 15 remenbraces, but the balancing of some bosses felt very off. Like, I can understand that Malenia would be very strong, but why would it make sense that she heals herself hitting your shield? In the end, I had to search for very specific Weapons and ashes to melt down her Life Bar. The same with the Elden Beast, due his immunities and running fight tactics, my regular weapons wouldnt make enough damage. After hours of trying, I had to research and change to a Black Fire Weapon to beat him. Finishing the game left me with regret, frustration and disappointment. Nothing close to what yould normally feel beating a Souls game.",124.4,12,0

"From the graphics to the music, to the storyline and to the gameplay, despite how hard it is, you can actually feel the need for 'true redemption' of each of the employees in the company. Hence, you get something that most people have been longing for that they don't even realize were lacking in their lives, that rare thing is what you call 'honesty'. There are very few video games in the world that are actually 'honest' and this game is obviously one of them.",130.2,0,1
The best Open World for Soulsborne veterans and newcomers alike. With unlimited possibility of play this is the new modern Darksouls With endless possibility of weapon choices and many challenges in your journey. You can easily sink 100 hours in your first week of the game with amazing world building telling by the legendary George R. R. Martin. Immersive visuals all under 50 Gigabytes make this a gold standard for games to follow in the future. With DLC coming soon being rumored to be as big as the full game this is the only game you can ever want for this years. Finally a game worthy of takeing my favorite game of all time.,228.7,0,1

"From the very first encounter this game makes it very clear that it's going to teach you how to play by killing you a lot. When you start it's going to feel ridiculously hard to the point where you may want to quit. But if you stick with it you'll find that because of that learning curve you can play the whole game with virtually any weapon or any build you want it will just take some (possibly a lot) of practice to master the ins and outs. Also because of that learning curve, when you finally do start wreaking bosses all the time the sense of accomplishment becomes that much more satisfying because you put in so much work to get there.",162.6,0,1

This is the first fromsoftaware game i completed the story in and the first soulslike game i completed i tried the others but i would probably say this is the most easy of them all and in the future i will probably play the other games and i will get the dlc for Elden ring also because it was so much fun. It was really nice with the open world and everything really good xD. I like the bloodfang blade and what i used the most this playthrough. Amazing sceneri and graphics with a really nice style to it all! 10 out of 10 baby!,55.5,0,1
"It's a new game from Dark Souls franchrise creators. It is super difficult yet rewarding game in which you need to show skill. The nice thing is open world game type. Previous games lacked that. BUT, Elden Ring doesn't have that darkness in it like other Souls have and it is slightly easier. The rest, so the combat system, music, enemies, cutscenes are on top. There is just darkness missing. Overall it is a solid 9/10. We will see what DLC will bring to us.",102.9,0,1
"well i became elden lord when the game first came out but i wanted to play it again so i purchased it on steam and am now aiming for NG+7, the only problem is... the game is too fun to just focus on the main objective which is increasing my total hours played. props to from software for doing something no-one else could. if you're new and want to try the game out. good luck and have fun!",72.1,0,1

"Elden Ring is hailed as one of fromsoftware's best games, combining elements of sekiro and dark souls 3 with an open-world akin to legend of zelda breath of the wild. The daunting boss fights are balanced by the expansive open world, allowing players to level grind and find items. summoning creatures, friends, or random players is convenient, and the massive map, along with the early introduction of a mount named torrent, adds to the game's depth. Im impressed by the fantastic, beautiful, and well-running game, praising its controls, combat, rich content, and a captivating world/story. if you appreciate developers dedicating time and love to their franchises, ""Elden Ring"" is deemed worth every penny",161.7,0,1

"The Masterpiece FromSoftware's Elden Ring, stands as a crowning achievement in the realm of action RPGs, seamlessly blending challenging gameplay, breathtaking world design, and a captivating narrative into an epic experience that will undoubtedly leave an indelible mark on the gaming landscape. At the heart of Elden Ring's allure is its masterful game design. The combat mechanics are a delicate dance of precision and timing, rewarding players for their skill and strategic prowess. Each swing of the sword, every dodge, and the unleashing of powerful magic spells feels weighty and impactful, creating an immersive combat experience that keeps you on the edge of your seat throughout your journey. The Lands Between The world of Elden Ring is a sprawling, interconnected marvel, teeming with secrets, lore, and a sense of awe-inspiring scale. From the verdant fields of the East Limgrave to the foreboding, otherworldly landscapes of the Weeping Peninsula, the attention to detail is nothing short of breathtaking. The freedom to explore this vast open-world at your own pace is both liberating and intoxicating, as you stumble upon hidden dungeons, encounter formidable foes, and uncover the rich history that permeates every inch of the Lands Between. The collaboration between Hidetaka Miyazaki and George R. R. Martin has birthed a narrative that is as compelling as it is enigmatic. The lore of Elden Ring is presented in a fragmented yet enthralling manner, leaving players hungry to piece together the mysteries of the world. The characters you encounter are memorable, each with their own stories and motivations, adding depth to the overarching narrative that propels you forward in your quest. Elden Ring is a feast for the eyes. The level of detail in the character designs, environmental textures, and the dynamic lighting system all contribute to a visual spectacle that surpasses expectations. The day-night cycle and dynamic weather seamlessly integrate into the gameplay, further immersing you in the living, breathing world of Elden Ring. Accompanying the visual spectacle is a hauntingly beautiful musical score that enhances the emotional resonance of every moment. From the melancholic melodies that underscore the desolation of certain areas to the triumphant orchestration that accompanies epic boss battles, the soundtrack elevates the entire gaming experience to new heights. In conclusion, Elden Ring is not just a game; it's an opus, a magnum opus that sets a new standard for what is possible in the realm of action RPGs. From its challenging gameplay to its breathtaking world design and captivating narrative, Elden Ring is a tour de force that will be remembered and revered for years to come. It's not merely a game you play; it's an experience you immerse yourself in, and one that will linger in your thoughts long after the credits roll.",321.2,0,1

"Elden Ring is a paradoxical masterpiece, a game that revels in its capacity to frustrate and captivate simultaneously. Its challenging landscapes and relentless difficulty might initially annoy, but they become the crucible for an addictive dance with adversity. This isn't just a game; it's a test of skill and resilience, turning setbacks into stepping stones towards mastery. The allure of Elden Ring lies not just in its infuriating charm but also in its rich lore and meticulously crafted world. Beyond the visual spectacle, it offers a journey where frustration transforms into fascination, and annoyance into admiration. To play Elden Ring is to willingly embrace the challenge, forging a unique bond between player and game in the heart of a beautifully maddening adventure.",491.1,0,1

this game is great. the combat is solid. it has a lot of cool mechanics and features. the general game play loop of exploration and enemy killing is fun. the only problem is the thing that ruins it for me. is the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bosses. there just unfair i think. i mean your not aloud to complain about it because people just ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ screech at you to get good. but it doesn't feel fair. its just this long ass memorization game of finding the one attack on a boss that's consistently punishable and baiting it over and over or summon something or someone to just make it easy as hell. whenever i try to fight a boss alone i never am able to heal or even just get attacks in . my only success with any melee build i tried was with a great hammer i was using to poise break everything. there just not fun to fight winning feels like getting lucky or cheesing and i never feel like im improving in any real way. and i proved that but doing a new melee build getting to margit and getting absolutely pummeled as soon as the summon died 4 times in a row. maybe im just bad and i was thinking that at first so kept pushing hoping that ide hit that moment that i did in ds3 where everything just clicked but it just not happening here. i cant recommend this game its a slog and it took enough of a toll on me that i quit gaming for a month. it gave me very very bad mental break downs because of how insanely difficult it was. and i didn't even see the worse bosses i quit after malikath because i couldn't get passed basic ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ enemies in certain areas any more.,110.0,3,0

Elden Ring is an absolutely top notch game if you're interested in a souls-like experience. The bosses are challenging and rewarding enough, the locations to explore are unique and speculator which really incentives you to explore every single area in the game to see what new things you can find.

"For all who know how are fromsoftware games like, this game is just what you'll think the greatest game in human history is. But for all who don`t know what a mean by that, this game has the following: Combat mechanics are great, exploration is 100% actual exploration (what a mean by that is that there isn`t a big maker on screen telling you exactly what you need to you as if your retarded.), it`s challenging and makes you really proud of that achivements you make along the way because it`s a hard game, PvE and PvP are just great, really deep and complex lore (which is really hard to new comers notice that`s there is an lore in the game), and thank God there are no microtransactions in this game.

Product received for free I love this game a lot. This is the first souls game I have actually took the time to play through and I don't regret it. First week of playing I racked up 92 hrs. The main thing that made it fun was grinding along side my friends on mods (ex: Seamless) and making a one shot solo build on the base game. I have yet to finish my build on my solo world and haven't touch new game plus at all. There is so much to do and the fact that it is open world makes it 10x better. I look forward to the upcoming updates and new dlc :),96.7,0,1

"I had never previosly played a From Software game before Elden Ring. I had very little experience with souls-likes, my only one being CODE VEIN which I had been playing on and off at that point, and never ended up finishing. By all accounts, this is not a game I ever thought I'd be interested in. But there was so much excitement about it on launch. It looked amazing. A friend had taken a week off work just to play Elden Ring. And so on an impulse, I purchased it too. Playing Elden Ring for the first time was one of the best gaming experiences I've ever had. ELDEN RING A Screenshot of ELDEN RING By: kitten SETTING ""The gold that enshrouds the heavens. The great tree which begets the pillars of light. O Tarnished, hasten to the foot of the tree."" Elden Ring is set in an open world of the Lands Between. It's jaw-droppingly beautiful, diverse, and most importantly - very good at encouraging and rewarding exploration. I will not say anything more - it happened more than once that getting into a new area would leave me in awe, and it is really worth experiencing on your own with minimal spoilers. The gameplay loop in Elden Ring is fairly simple. You explore, you kill monsters, you get stonger by acquiring gear and levels, and use all this strength to beat big bad bosses to become the baddest boss of all - the Elden Lord. Combat feels nice and smooth, and it's pretty easy to get the gist of even if you're new. You have your normal melee weapons, you have bows, you have magic... and each weapon also comes with a special strong ability called Ashes of War. And all of it works, and looks, and feels absolutely amazing. And if that's not enough, the game offers an ability to summon NPC spirits to aid you in battle - specifically in bigger fights and boss fights. This makes Elden Ring very accessible to newer players, who are trying it as their first From Software game. Don't get me wrong though - Best part - due to the open world nature of the game, if you're stuck somewhere, or just don't like the place, you can simply turn around and leave! Return later, or not at all, it's really up to you. You can play with the controller or on keyboard & mouse setup, the latter of which works very well so you don't really a controller if you don't already own one. ...I'll actually go on a side tangent about controls. Unlike DS3, where it is impossible to get the UI to display keyboard controls, which makes playing on KBM an absolute headache of confusion, UI in Elden Ring fully supports KBM (you just... still need to find how to switch it because the controller controls are considered default, sigh), and the game itself is nicely* optimised** for KBM controls. (*not perfectly, just nicely) (**you can do everything you can on the controller, you may just need a bit of time to figure out some Ashes of War with double component - there's some clicking trickery involved) Elden Ring is a game that I really want to recommend to everyone... But I'm sure that, despite what I think about it, it might not be everyone's cup of tea (my boyfriend is still not letting me live that recommendation down...). But, if you enjoy beautiful worlds, poetic and enigmatic storytelling, and engaging exploration, and you aren't afraid to try something scary and new - maybe this is something you should really, really give a go. 10/10 best game ever",245.9,3,1

"Beautiful graphics, immersive world you can traverse without guidance, but you can still get lost in it without feeling overwhelmed and find your path later on. The story, although mostly hidden and only understandable if you look for it on the Internet, is very well set and very interesting. Although it can seem very difficult, there are many ways to make this game easy, or adapt it to any play style or level you enjoy. The artistic part of the game is outstanding. The graphics are perfect and it's optimized very well in my experience. The colors coordinate perfectly and they are very distinct in the different areas of the game, really separating the many biomes in the map. The atmosphere truly expresses the area's stories and backgrounds, surprising you when you all of a sudden change completely the landscape when going up an elevator, or going down in a deep cave. The enemies and character's designs are extremely detailed and you can just take a moment to appreciate the small accents that make up the larger picture. In terms of soundtrack, as always FromSoftware released the perfect accompanying songs that match the fights and areas, they are fully orchestrated pieces from the master Yuka Kitamura and Tsukasa Saitoh amongst others, really making it obvious that videogame music and OSTs can be true classical music. It really adds up to the experience and rounds it up to be a masterpiece. Overall, I think Elden Ring is a before and after in the gaming space, influencing greatly a lot of new titles, and really impacting the player's expectations and experiences with videogames. If you are new to this ""difficult"" genre and are thrown back by the difficulty, I highly suggest you try it out and, with patience, when you understand the game, you will be able to truly enjoy it.",60.3,1,1

Which is where I think the game stands out. I'm not much of a souls guy, I've played all of em, only beaten 3. And out of all of em I played this one is up with bloodborne.

"""Spend souls or lose them"" Yes... that same Elden Ring that has some of the vibe in it. There are a lot of all sorts of harmless living creatures (except for the ram that rams you). Good atmosphere, VERY BIG map... and that's good, it's even super. But let’s not talk about that... There are a lot of beautiful landscapes in this game, and you ride your horse “Roach” (P.S. reference to the Witcher 3) through such beautiful places, through forests and even in a city equipped with gold or simply destroyed and all infected. Beautiful locations, many secrets and traps, etc. I will highlight the advantages: -many different bosses and their rewards -open world - a variety of weapons, armor and magic -class selection (there are fewer of them in souls games) -beauty of locations I think everyone who played has their own advantages, and everyone will write what else they like, there are many advantages, it would take a long time to list them... Minuses: -a large number of repeating mini-bosses -some “ordinary opponents” are very strong, almost like mini-bosses (take the crow for example) -loot is not updated in NG+ and beyond (in souls games when you play in NG+ your chests are updated and at least there is something in them and not empty as in this game, this really disappointed me) -it’s not clear where there are hidden rooms (Seriously? Yes. It’s really not clear where they are and you have to go to the wiki) That's all for now, I advise everyone who hasn't played to play it. Yes, she’s not like souls, although I’m a fan of playing souls games, but she also deserves good attention...",125.0,0,1

"Just to be clear I love the game! It is fantastic! This is the first time I ever played Elden Ring (at the time of writing this review). The reason why I’m giving negative is because of a boss called ""Malenia, Blade of Miquella"". I have died about 60-70 times to this single boss. (I know a lot of people died even more times but for me, this is the threshold) I tried parry, dodge, shield, spears, fast weapons, strong weapons, freeze, blood loss.... basically, anything reasonable. I can still only reach Phase 2 after every 10-12 deaths, just to die from her special attack. (I have spent about 10 hours fighting THIS single boss) At first, I said to myself: ""Well, well, well... this is a challenging boss!"" Then it became really annoying for a long-long time.... And now this is the point where I become bored by this single boss fight. Don't get me wrong, I still find the rest of the game amazing but when they created Malenia, they really didn't think it through. It feels like they just wanted to do something CRAZY OP boss but they ended up creating a boring one for first time players, which kind of ruins the whole experience. I’m hoping they might change her just a tiny-tiny bit. (No major change is needed, just tiny tweaks to make it more First Timer Friendly IMO)",110.0,0,0

"The Industrial Revolution and its consequences have been a disaster for the human race. They have greatly increased the life-expectancy of those of us who live in “advanced” countries, but they have destabilized society, have made life unfulfilling, have subjected human beings to indignities, have led to widespread psychological suffering (in the Third World to physical suffering as well) and have inflicted severe damage on the natural world. The continued development of technology will worsen the situation. It will certainly subject human beings to greater indignities and inflict greater damage on the natural world, it will probably lead to greater social disruption and psychological suffering, and it may lead to increased physical suffering even in “advanced” countries. The industrial-technological system may survive or it may break down. If it survives, it MAY eventually achieve a low level of physical and psychological suffering, but only after passing through a long and very painful period of adjustment and only at the cost of permanently reducing human beings and many other living organisms to engineered products and mere cogs in the social machine. Furthermore, if the system survives, the consequences will be inevitable: There is no way of reforming or modifying the system so as to prevent it from depriving people of dignity and autonomy. If the system breaks down the consequences will still be very painful. But the bigger the system grows the more disastrous the results of its breakdown will be, so if it is to break down it had best break down sooner rather than later. We therefore advocate a revolution against the industrial system. This revolution may or may not make use of violence; it may be sudden or it may be a relatively gradual process spanning a few decades. We can’t predict any of that. But we do outline in a very general way the measures that those who hate the industrial system should take in order to prepare the way for a revolution against that form of society. This is not to be a POLITICAL revolution. Its object will be to overthrow not governments but the economic and technological basis of the present society. In this article we give attention to only some of the negative developments that have grown out of the industrial-technological system. Other such developments we mention only briefly or ignore altogether. This does not mean that we regard these other developments as unimportant. For practical reasons we have to confine our discussion to areas that have received insufficient public attention or in which we have something new to say. For example, since there are well-developed environmental and wilderness movements, we have written very little about environmental degradation or the destruction of wild nature, even though we consider these to be highly important.",279.2,1,1

"There is a lot of fun to be had here if you are a gamer who is able to get timings, fast paced combat, and quick decision making down to an art form; just like all Soulsborne games. Though I would not recommend this game for someone who has never been introduced to the series before. There are certainly easier Soulsborne titles for that. But for those who are well versed in the formula, this is well worth a play through or 2 or 3. The open world aspect actually does work well with the Souls formula and combat remains as intense and fun as it always is. There is also a vast horde of weapons, sorceries, and armor sets that really do impact how the game is played. Armor feels like it actually matters. There can be a learning curve at first for even veteran players. It kind of feels like I'm a Dark Souls protag facing Bloodborne enemies sometimes. But once you get the old Soulsborne flow going, you're gonna have a lot of fun. The endgame is a bit weird with the boss rush and I do experience a lot of crashes in the Leyndell area. I also do wish there were more unique bosses and more thrilling soundtracks like the other games in the series have. But if you can overlook the small problems with the game, this certainly will be worth your time. Yeah, I feel I have fun playing this.",134.3,0,1

"ELDEN RING, this was the biggest hype train i ever got on, and it was worth it mostly. This game delivers on hidden cryptic deep lore better than any other game i have played and if your going in looking for that you will not be disappointed. Combat being the meat and potatoes of the game is fine, its a refinement of Darksouls 3 combat with the addition of jumping, counter attacks and ashes of war along with the return of power-stancing from DS 2. Spells and Incantations feel like a direct improvement as well from the dark souls games, with more interesting incantations and some interesting spells, they all feel good to use. The exploration is easily this games biggest strong suit, easily outclassing most other games in sheer scale and detail there in. Bosses in Elden Ring range from excellent to horrible, many main bosses are great fights, very difficult fights in many cases, but great fights, the side bosses are generally fine but some of them just feel pretty bad to fight, like the falling star beasts and ulcerated tree spirits. however in my opinion the final boss is a disappointment and the stat scaling from later zones is blown way out of proportion. The music is of course is masterfully made, everything from the somber ambiance of Limbgrave to the grand score of Radahn, its all great. Graphics, as usual the graphical fidelity is not supper high but it doesn't need it, the stellar art direction carries this game into the clouds, it looks fantastic. I rate ELDEN RING a silid 8.5/10 P.S if you are interested in doing co-op look into the Seamless Co-op mod, it is a much better experience and very easy to use.",940.3,0,1

I get that it is just a game but the thought that I could have been spending this one hundred hours doing things that actually mattered and playing games that I would actually get to beat instead of losing everything i had worked toward just makes me a very very sad man. I am going to go continue to be sad now. Thanks for reading.",116.6,1,0
"44 hours in and i have yet to find the 10 out of 10 graphics, atmosphere, amazing open world, and story of which so far there isn't one. the little side quests you do are confusingly laid out and poorly designed. the movement engine feels like source gold got a third person mode, and the combat is slow, uninspired, and levied so heavily in the enemy's favor that it's not even funny. The enemies in this game follow the path of rather than being challenging in their own unique ways beyond resistances to certain weapon types or magic, are simply massive damage sponges that deal 50+ percent of your hp regardless of armor used. this game does not deserve game of the year and is by far one of the most boring and grind heavy, and dead feeling games i have ever played",71.6,2,0
"Get some sort of guide or walkthrough video to start you out, especially since this is such a wide open world game with no clear direction. FightinCowboy's is fantastic. If this isn't your first Souls game, you might be fine, but again, the video is helpful.",155.9,0,1
"By far the worst installment in the series. If you have to make all of the unique enemies and bosses delay every attack and emulate Gael from DS3 (spinning like a beyblade, non-stop combos) just to provide a ""challenge"", the game is doodoo. never addressed the other gripes that have been consistent across the Souls series either.

"While no longer available to purchase on Steam, Rocket League is still playable here for anyone who purchased it before Epic made it exclusive on their platform. Rocket League is a fantastic game, taking the game of soccer and combining it with RC cars. Utilizing boosts and a 2 ""jumps"", you learn aerial tricks to outsmart the opposing team, and score goals against them. There's plenty of room to learn and grow, while earning skins thru events and seasonal progression. Rocket League is Free-to-play on Epic, and runs perfectly fine on Linux, using the Heroic Games launcher and Valve's Proton compatibility. *****",516.5,0,1

But matchmaking is absolute garbage recently. (Matchmaking wasn't great before, but it was mostly fine.) Now, many of my matches have fresh-account weirdos playing out-of-skill-band, apparently just wanting to dunk on folks or something.

"As you see I've been playing for so long. I basically fell in love with this game in the initial phases before the infamous Epic games acquisition. Since Epic games got their slimy hands over this beautiful game, the have not added anything. They turned this game into nothing but a piggy bank for them and the community guided game just vanished. The only updates you get are item shop items and more ways to spend money. You get ""Quality of life updates"" that yes are nice, but really don't do anything to the actual game experience. No new content, no new modes since that free for all knockout game-mode released last year. Before that game-mode update we literally had nothing for approximately 3 years. This game feels like it was abandoned by the devs and it is really sad to see such a wonderful game slowly die off",2628.2,1,0

"Rocket League is like that unexpected fusion dish you order at a restaurant and end up wondering how you lived without it. It's the love child of soccer and car racing, and let me tell you, it's a match made in gaming heaven. Picture this: cars with the finesse of soccer players, zooming around the field, pulling off epic aerial stunts to score goals. It's like a Pixar movie on adrenaline. The developers at Psyonix must have been thinking, ""Hey, why not slap some rocket boosters on these bad boys and see what happens?"" Well, what happened is pure, unadulterated fun. The balance in Rocket League is like a perfectly executed gymnastics routine. It's not just about who can drive the fastest; it's about strategy, teamwork, and, let's face it, a bit of luck. The game keeps you on your toes (or should I say wheels?) with its dynamic gameplay. One moment you're defending the goal like a pro goalie, and the next, you're soaring through the air for an aerial goal that would make any striker jealous. After 400 hours of playtime, you might expect the novelty to wear off. But no, Rocket League is like that friend who always has a new joke up their sleeve. Every match feels fresh, and you never know what ridiculous play is about to unfold. It's the kind of game that keeps you coming back for more, and before you know it, your car has its own personality, and you've named it something absurd like ""Goalinator3000."" Rocket League is the perfect recipe for laughter, competition, and the occasional ""did that just happen?"" moment. It's the only game where you can scream, ""I'm flying, Ma!"" without anyone batting an eye. So buckle up, rev those engines, and get ready for a gaming experience that's as unpredictable as a squirrel crossing the road during rush hour. Rocket League: where soccer meets vroom vroom, and boredom is left in the dust.",497.0,2,1

P2P trading is gone, crates are gone, and the only thing they've produced have been an (admittedly fun) limited time game mode, that's been in cycle 3 times since release in 2022. Rocket league is not here on steam anymore, and it still has more features than the epic version. If RL 2 is ever released, or if they try ADDING features, I'll give it a shot. Until then I cant support a company sabotaging their own game the way the RL team has done. . . . . . Rocket league for me has always been an escape.

"Before this game moved to Epic it was great. Sure the community was always horrendous, but at least the people slamming you for incompetence were, more often than not, actually competent themselves.. But I am not here to talk about the community. I am here to talk about how the game goes if you're not in a 3-man premade team. You enter the game, there is a 90% chance that one of your 2 teammates is just going to sit there idling. There are literally videos on youtube that I found while looking for some answer to this epidemic that teach you how to download a bot that will make it so the idle-kick mechanic doesn't detect you idling. All because of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ loot crates and XP farming... So.. Now you have a bunch of 10-14 year olds who used to have to ask permission to get a game who just get to join in with no consequence or restriction. On top of that, you have every trade-scammer able to make 200 accounts and just infinitely ruin games with no repercussions.. This game is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Every match is like swimming through raw sewage looking for a platinum turd to make it worthwhile and then, once you think you found it, it's just a regular turd sprayed with chrome. If you don't have enough people to fill a team of your preferred size (2 or 3), who want to play and practice with you constantly.... Don't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ bother.",788.8,1,0

I had work at 8am, called off to sleep and play more car soccer instead. The game has experienced many changes and mechanical discoveries since those days. I never was interested in ranked, so I played mostly casual lobbies and free play. However, I am interested in seeing where I stand these days. The best times are when you are just feeling like you are part of the car. You are executing everything you are capable of seeing at will. You can make no mistake, the vibe. The worst times are when you encounter a toxic community member or you go on a losing streak of hard fought OT games. Lots of opportunities to experience the highest of highs or the lowest of lows. My advice is to control your emotions, have fun, and set the good example. You can not control what someone else does, but you can control how you respond \ react. The game is FREE on Epic now. Not even sure you can get it on Steam anymore.",2431.9,1,1

"This is as close as it gets to a perfect video game. An extremely low skill floor and an impossibly high skill ceiling. With the simplest objective of 'get the ball in the goal', and a million different ways to make that happen, I have little doubt that I will be playing this for many more years to come. Super fast to boot up and get into a match, and matches last 5-10 minutes, then you are on to the next one. Easy to pick up and play and come back to over and over. So if it is 2023 or later and you are on the fence about playing a free to play game that has been out for years and are reading this review, just install it. 10/10 game",1601.3,0,1

"8/10 Content - Would give 10 but Epic ruined it. Thanks Epic Games! 0/10 Publisher - This game has not been the same since it became F2P, thanks Epic Games! 0/10 Community - Always been sh!t, even with Psyonix, but now it's worse. Thanks Epic Games! Do not under any circumstances play this game with voice or text chat turned on. Unless you like torture. Text chat is filled with 4ssholes with big egos who think they are amazing but play like they are drunk and blame you for everything, unless they decide to own-goal you until you quit, then they mysteriously become SSL. Voice chat is filled with drunks and weirdos. There are multiple types of ""casuals"" infecting this game, some of which include: - 12-year-old-minded 30 year old inceIs whose life is RL but they never gotten past Champ. - People playing drunk who play based on the imaginary car they see on their double vision. - People playing high who think they can hit every aerial but can't read the play because snoop dog is sitting on their car and they can't focus on the ball. - Plain out idiots -- according to stAUTISTICs this is the highest population in the game. - The-world-revolves-around-me-and-I-am-the-best-player-ever players --in their perspective, only because they hit CHAMP once in their lifetime. - AFK-starter or people who go AFK in the middle of a competitive match to go pet their f#cking dog. - Trolls with no life. - I-haven't-seen-PU$$Y-since-I-came-out-one players. If you think any of the above is false, you are one of them. I played with chat off for most of my time since I get distracted by the trolls spamming quick-chat, turned it on for a change thinking it would be different than a few years ago. NOPE, people talk sh!t like it's their day job and blame you for their mistakes. It only gets worse if you respond too. Really wish this game was not free to play, it would at least take some of the trolls and 4ssholes out of the game.",3728.2,3,0

"After well over 800 hours, I can say that no I do not recommend Rocket League in 2023. Psyonix turned it into a mega cash-grab loot box style gachafest with a ridiculous item-based economy. Later, the game was sold to Epic and further destroyed. The game was nice when it had minimal microtransactions and cost $15. I don't recommend it because it's currently marketed as an esport for kids with too much money. The game controlled well when it was simple, the menus have been complicated and there is nothing particularly interesting about new maps or mechanics. When the game was simple, they (psyonix) had it perfect and they lost it. Don't waste your time. It takes hundreds of hours to get ""good"" and even if you do, you still get yelled at and called slurs by 13 year olds. Community is trash",784.5,0,0

The extra modes are a joke now. The pass is never worth it. New content is almost always behind a paywall, with a 1,000+ in 1 chance to drop.

I loved how well Psyonics communicated with their players and I loved how they truly tried to give us the most fun experience we could have. Unfortunately, after Epic got a hold of the game, it has taken a turn for the worst. I do not feel ranked is a good indicator of skill, I believe that Epic does not care about it's players and actively sees them as an ends to a means ONLY (more money). There is no love in this game any more, this is a soulless cash grab now. If you are thinking of getting into this game. Don't, there are far better uses for your time.

"Unique and fun game overall. Terrible community, even worse than LoL, and that says a lot. Greedy company removes part of the game rather than add anything new or meaningful.

"i have been playing this game since it came out almost 10 years ago. i have almost 4k hours. it used to be an incredibly competitive game with a great player base but ever since epic took over, this game has gone to absolute s***. you used to be able to solo queue and be confident in your teammate, or at least know that your tm wants to win. currently, it is next to impossible to be competitive and climb ranks in the game as a solo queue because 50% of time your tm will be AFK or be toxic and throw the game 30 seconds in. Also, there used to be a huge sub community of players that you could trade items with. items held value. not anymore. they are removing player to player trading and with the current reward system, collecting items is useless. i have over 100 unopened crates because there is no point in opening them. It is so sad to see the downward spiral of this game. all that is has going for it is RLCS and the true competition events. playing as a casual player is no longer fun, and i am retiring from playing, unfortunately. absolute garbage now dont buy it",3717.6,1,0

"Ah, Rocket League. What started as a beautiful romance between me and this vehicular soccer game quickly turned sour, leaving me feeling bewildered and resentful. With a heavy heart, I bid farewell to a relationship that once brought joy but eventually descended into frustration and disappointment. Initial Infatuation: In the beginning, Rocket League had me smitten. The excitement of fast-paced matches and gravity-defying stunts filled me with a sense of wonder. It was love at first boost as I glued my eyes to the screen, adoring the beautiful fusion of cars and football. The potential seemed limitless, and I was prepared to dive headfirst into this exhilarating relationship. The Ups and Downs: Like any tumultuous relationship, Rocket League had its fair share of ups and downs. At times, I found myself flying high with epic goals and remarkable saves, basking in the glory of victory. These moments were nothing short of electrifying and undeniably addictive. However, these highs were frequently met with crushing defeats, leaving me frustrated and questioning my own abilities. [6:48 PM] Communication Breakdown: Somewhere along the way, communication between Rocket League and me deteriorated. Whether it was the unpredictable physics, unreliable servers, or the relentless opponents who seemed to defy logic, our once harmonious connection transformed into a jumbled mess. It became increasingly difficult to predict the game's whims, and this lack of consistency fueled my mounting resentment. The Toxic Players: Ah, the toxicity that seeped into our relationship! Rocket League unfortunately attracted a slew of players who thrived on taunting and belittling their opponents. The insults hurled at me were a constant [6:48 PM] reminder that the community had become a breeding ground for negativity. It was disheartening to witness the demise of the once-uplifting atmosphere that captured my heart. The Breaking Point: Finally, after enduring countless heart-wrenching defeats and enduring toxicity, I reached my breaking point. The initial love that captured my soul had eroded into an overwhelming frustration that no amount of satisfying goals could alleviate. Our breakup became inevitable, as the relief of walking away outweighed the lingering remnants of affection. Conclusion: Rocket League, our journey together has indeed been a rocky one. What began as a passionate affair eventually soured, plagued by inconsistent gameplay, toxic attitudes, and the bittersweet taste of defeat. While there were moments of undeniable pleasure, the overall experience left me longing for something more stable and fulfilling. It's time for me to bid adieu to this turbulent relationship and seek solace elsewhere in the gaming world.",1418.6,0,0

"Abusive teammates will flame you in chat and sabotage the game for the smallest mistakes. Memories of your dad yelling at you in pee wee soccer come rushing back. Matchmaking is also plagued with smurfs who'll stunt on you like Team Iceland in D2: The Mighty Ducks. Psyonix's response to smurfing is unfortunately laissez-faire. That being said, it's a totally unique competitive experience in gameplay if not community. The closest you can get to simulating sports with a controller in your hands. Most importantly, it's fun at every point of the learning curve. And with a bit of persistence, you'll be pulling off moves you never thought capable of your old hands. You might eventually reflect on how much better your life could've been if you applied the same level of focus to something constructive... nah. This is Rocket League!",1557.7,0,1

"Uninstalled, game officially ruined and is only for EPIC's consistent cash grab (which they are getting sued for or were already sued by the way) - The RED Disney Cars car sealed the deal. Likely the best game defining what e-sports should look like continues to do stupid little cash grabs for what is nothing more than a 3d model and a texture wrapped around it. It has no tangible value (not even for trade)... but it devalued the ♥♥♥♥ out of a game that has teams that are deciphered by color. When was the last time you saw two teams in any sport where half of each team wore the jersey of the opposing team? Are you ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ kidding me? So now instead of playing rocket league, you're playing ""name plate league"" because that's the only thing that visually identifies the player of the opposing team by color. But hey, i suppose every team player in football (no matter which kind of football you choose) should all wear different color jerseys... You let me know how the game pans out when you instead have to remember the numbers on the jersey instead of the team that represents you by the way they look. This would be the equivalent of playing counter-strike, being on the counter-terrorist team, but using a terrorist skin.... its stupid AF for any competitive activity where teams should appear similar.

There is no way to play this game without trying to learn a new way to manipulate these vehicles both through the air and around the field.

You will not find a game like this and it stands the test of time as the player count continues to keep it one of the most played games on steam!",246.2,0,1
"My opinions about Rocket League: The single most competitive game I've ever played that also requires a skill set that can be learned from both experience and through training. This provides the challenge I prefer in games. As far as training goes, there is an abundance of pro and others that are willing to teach what they have learned -- skills and mechanics -- to improve your game. Finally; IF you get ""Good Enough"" to go ""Pro"" - SSL+ it may be possible to earn some ""extra cash"" while playing Rocket League. Yeppur!!",1221.5,0,1
"At the beginning of the path down the trash can, Rocket League was removed from Steam, but remained playable for everyone who bought it at the time. Ok, the Steam community thought, what the hell. Epic had once again put money on the table and lured or bought the developers. Next, trading and crafting items were made more difficult and blueprints were introduced that everyone hates. Ok, thinks the community, it only goes downhill from here. Last but not least, in-game item trading between players has been completely removed from the game. Wow... I'm almost ashamed that I thought back then that Psyonix had turned a cool concept into a top game with Rocket League and had done a good job using fair methods and skin systems. The Steam community that made Rocket League the money-making machine it is today is now just tolerated and eventually thrown in the trash. Another good example of how capitalism turns the best man into the greediest moneybag who doesn't give a ♥♥♥♥ about anything.",622.6,13,0

"I am a 580 yo father, probably one of the oldest people playing this game. I am a multi farther to my Sony, who is 14 now. My sony got this game for Christmassio in 2052 from his squid, so we installed it on his left arm and he started twerking. By the end of the decade he had 24 seconds on this game. This was a turn on for me, as it was already hard for me to find ways to spend time with my sony, as he is always out with his fish or just watching Tranytube. So I decided to make a Steamed ham and get this sauce (HP) to see if I could maybe eat him. I loaded into the stockroom, picked my nose and arse and started playing but I was stuck on what you where supposed to fist. I asked my Sony for help and he hosted an orgy for me to join. I loved it as it was the best time I had spanked with my Sony since my wifi had died. This game has ever since brought me and my sony closer again and now we actually sniff a lot of crack together outside the house as well. This typical fluffed fire support penguin reminded me that there's fun to be had in everything, and it has brought both me and my Sony many happy stools.",165.1,0,1

"Over 1000 hours in this game. Loved it since launch and always come back to it. Removing player trading is BY FAR the stupidest decision any company has ever made for any singular game that I have ever seen. If you don't understand why this matters, I want you to imagine if DOTA2 or CSGO removed trading. Yes, that is how stupid this decision is. Pure unadulterated greed and tone-deafness of epic games. People have made full-on businesses with player trading involved. Epic is removing it, and then charging 3x the price for items that could have been traded from player to player. Want to buy a Fennec body? that'll be 1000 credits instead of the average 300 credits you can get it for from other players. Want to get a cool goal explosion? That'll be 1800 credits instead of ~500 credits or so. Want to get some neat wheels that aren't super rare? That'll be 300 credits instead of 50 credits. Epic doesn't care about you.

"I don't care about trading unlike the majority of the fanbase, which I respect. But the biggest problem for me in recent months is matchmaking. I've always loved this game for a fair TRUE skill-based matchmaking, when every game was a challenge and a nail-biter with close scores. But recently everything changed and I have no idea why, maybe because there are not so many players left. One game you play against people who are obviously a lot less skilled than you and it ends up in a forfeit, the very next game we are playing against absolute monsters and get crashed the same way. And the cycle repeats. So that's how they achieve a 50% win rate nowadays I guess",1115.2,1,0

Tbh loved the game at first but in order to progress and get far in the comp scene you have to put so much time into practice and with someone who has a job and a family to care to I cant spend free time in training doing drills and stuff so im hard stuck champ 2. So if you just gonna play with friends its whatever but if you want to go far in comp you have to no life this game and pledge your life to it which i am not for.

The match making alg is designed to make it almost impossible to move up with out a party. It dose not matter how you play you will always loose 5 sometimes 8 games in a row. no way thats possible naturally. online games used to be great now its you just battling the alg.

"Highly competitive, and fun game initially. There seems to be little to no penalty for throwing games, griefing teammates, and full on leaving ranked games. I've played Rocket League on and off for a long time. Long enough to get 2510 hours in it. With friends, it's great. Solo play, or matchmaking a team has driven me to stop playing. An example is, the last 4-5 games I played tonight my partner quit or started shooting on our own goal when the other team got one goal on us, even if we were winning. A while back an update added a hint to turn off chat if you can't handle the salty attitudes, but there is no way to counteract a quitter or griefer when playing, and reporting doesn't seem to change anything.",2537.3,0,0

Trading was a huge thing in the game that gave the whole player base something else to enjoy and have fun with and they took it away so they can be money hogging pigs once again. Epic is known to value money over everything. First it was crates taken away, now its trading. The game is bound to fail sooner than later. It used to be a ""flex"" to have certain toppers, wheels, boosts, goal explosions, decals, and Epic decided to take that away so they can implement a new kind of shop where all of these items are just going to constantly cycle in and out. Now yes, there has been a shop for a long time where they would cycle some hot topic items that would ""force"" players to buy them due to FOMO (fear of missing out). I used to be a huge trader and collector myself and that fact that they are taking it all away is going to be a huge detriment to the game.

"My playtime, although rookie numbers for some, is proof enough that I quite enjoyed this game. But Epic Games seems to like digging a bigger and bigger hole for themselves. The car soccer itself hasn't changed at all (for better or worse), but the customization seems to get worse with each update for the regular free-to-play player. Now by removing trading, the only items that the average ballchaser will have access to is ones that were free back when the game had to be paid for, and these godawful ones that they keep releasing through the free pass and ingame events (lofi girl, seriously?). I know they're fishing for more people to pay for credits and buy from their trash item shop, or purchase the rocket pass (which often has like 2 good items per season), but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, how much money do you friggin need?",1074.5,1,0

"Rocket League bukan sebuah ""permainan olahraga"" dan lebih merupakan olahraga yang sebenarnya. Di FIFA atau Madden, Anda memiliki tombol ""oper"", tetapi untuk melakukan operan di Rocket League, Anda harus mengemudikan mobil Anda ke arah bola dengan kecepatan dan sudut yang tepat untuk mengirimkannya ke arah rekan satu tim Anda. Anda harus membuat operan sendiri, dan bisa berupa apa saja, mulai dari pantulan keras dari dinding belakang hingga lob lembut melewati pemain bertahan. Mengumpan, menembak, menggiring bola, melakukan tekel, melakukan gerakan tipuan, semuanya ada di dalam permainan, tetapi Anda harus mewujudkannya sendiri, bukan hanya menekan tombol yang tepat. Pada awalnya, mengemudikan mobil ke bola saja sudah merupakan tantangan, tetapi seiring dengan meningkatnya keahlian Anda, kebebasan untuk menciptakan permainan apa pun yang dapat Anda bayangkan dan jalankan tidak seperti apa pun yang Anda temukan dalam ""permainan olahraga"". Bersama dengan keterampilan mekanis untuk melakukan apa yang Anda inginkan dengan bola, Anda harus mengembangkan kesadaran posisi dan mempelajari rotasi yang tepat dan rasa permainan.",19.8,0,1

"Rocket League has and will more than likely continue to be, a journey. I took a leap of faith originally purchasing this game for 19.99 on Xbox one days a little while after it launched, then bought on PC shortly after. I would say this game is one of a kind, allowing for a competitive sports game like nothing else, while simultaneously being a really enjoyable game to simply play as a game for fun with friends in a party setting. As long as they don't change core mechanics or the gameplay, this game will live(and likely thrive) for a very long time, regardless of the latest Epic Games disaster update removing PtP trading out of greed. It's free, at least to play. Get Bakkesmod.",2079.7,8,1

This game was already a dead mess. The game was already stale as it was as someone who put in close to 1000 hours in 2020 alone. The game was dying out after epic had bought it with them removing crates and trying to kill any fun the game had left in it. The community in this game was bad when i started playing in 2016 but has just seemed to get even worse over the years so i haven't really touched it or even payed any attention. Until i saw they removed trading... why... what moron did that.

( WAIT.....no....they only changed it do to the legal/forced to reasons ) -Psyonix and EA are some of the only companies that really understand that in ""Competitive Ranked"" game play ""Smack talking"" your opponent before a match has been a effective strategy since the creation of ""Competitive sport"".they understand emotions can run high and are mature and fair about bans and perma bans. (WAIT....no....you can still get perma ban if people 'FEEL LIKE' you deserve to be banned cause you made fun of their mother with a "" yo momma so phat"" joke. -Psyonix and EA treat all players equally, regardless if they are a normal player, ""popular streamer "" or "" popular competitive player/team"" ( HA!!) (HA HA HA!!!) (HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHHAHAHAHHAHHAHA...*gasp* HAHAHHAHAHAHHHAHAHAHHAHAHHAHAHAHHHAH) -Psyonix and EA are aged and mature company's that understand introducing new/recently developed politics along with political based content into their game, weather its through the "" terms of service "" or "" game content"" , will have a short term gain but long term negative effects to their game so they remain neutral since they are only "" ENTERTAINMENT"" not a public bill board for the highest bidder.
